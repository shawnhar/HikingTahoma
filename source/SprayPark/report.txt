Positioned on the wet northwest flank of Rainier, Spray Park hosts an 
extraordinary profusion of wildflowers. Also, mosquitoes. So many biters 
that I once overheard a couple up here having what sounded like a 
relationship-ending argument where one wanted to go further while the other 
was being eaten alive, and there was much blame about which one forgot the 
bug spray.

Ah, but the flowers. They're worth a small blood sacrifice :-)

Start at Mowich Lake, at the end of a dusty, potholed road. Hike south, ever 
so gently downhill, through luscious forest. Two miles in, take the short 
detour to the almost annoyingly archetypal waterfall, Spray Falls. The 
official path ends with an ok view, but scrambling up closer can yield a 
much better one.

After Spray Falls the trail starts to gain altitude, switchbacking upward 
through forest before arriving at the open alpine meadows of Spray Park 
itself. Check out the summit views to the right, and Mother Mountain to the 
left, and flowers everywhere, and ouch, swat, quit biting my arm you %$#@!

There is no set turnaround point here. The meadows continue upward for 
another mile, with increasing likelihood of encountering snow patches the 
higher you get. Hike as far as you want, but please stay on the main trail 
(ignoring the many side trails eroded by others less considerate) as the 
beauty of these flowers would not be enhanced by your boot prints.
