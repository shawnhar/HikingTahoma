Positioned on the rainy northwest flank of Rainier, the expansive meadows of 
Spray Park host an extraordinary profusion of wildflowers. Also, mosquitoes. 
So many biters that I once overheard a couple up here having what sounded 
like a relationship-ending argument when one wanted to go further while the 
other was being eaten alive, and there was much blame about who forgot the 
bug spray.

Ah, but the flowers, and the views. They're worth the occasional blood 
sacrifice :-)

Start at Mowich Lake, the end of a dusty, potholed road. Hike south, ever so 
gently downhill, through luscious forest. After two miles take the short 
detour to the almost annoyingly archetypal waterfall, Spray Falls. The 
official path to the falls ends with an ok view, but scrambling up closer 
can yield a much better one.

Past Spray Falls the trail gains altitude, switchbacking through forest 
before arriving at the open alpine meadows of Spray Park itself. Check out 
the summit views to the right, and Mother Mountain to the left, and flowers 
everywhere, and ouch, swat, quit biting my arm you %$#@!

There is no set turnaround point here. The meadows continue upward for 
another mile, with increasing likelihood of encountering snow patches the 
higher you go. Hike as far as you want, but please stay on the main trail 
and ignore the many side paths eroded by others less considerate. The 
lushness of this vegetation would not be enhanced by your boot prints.
