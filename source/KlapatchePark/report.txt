Klapatche Park is one of the most fabled campsites along the [Wonderland]. Most 
Wonderland camps are quiet places in the forest, at locations chosen to maximize shelter 
and preservation of wilderness while leaving the big views for the trail itself. A few of 
the camps, though, are themselves special places, rather than just somewhere to sleep in 
between one trail day and the next. Summerland. Indian Bar. Klapatche Park. These are 
names of legend to Rainier backpackers.

Klapatche Park is the most remote of these great campsites, located on the rugged west 
side of Mount Rainier. Along the Wonderland it is 15 miles north of Longmire, or 16.5 
south of Mowich Lake. There are no trailheads on the Wonderland between Longmire and 
Mowich, but Klapatche Park can also be accessed from the Westside Road, which is the 
route described here.

There are multiple choices along this hike:

<ul>
<li>
    Walk or bike the Westside Road section?
</li>
<li>
    From Round Pass, take the Round Pass Trail (shorter, steeper, forested) or continue 
    along the Westside Road (necessary if you're on a bike)?
</li>
<li>
    Hike up the South Puyallup Trail to the Wonderland, or continue further along the 
    Westside Road to the St. Andrews Creek Trail? It's roughly the same distance either 
    way, so why not make a loop of it? (I went up the South Puyallup, and came back down 
    St. Andrews Creek)
</li>
<li>
    Extend the hike to include [NorthPuyallup]?
</li>
</ul>

I've described the first part of this route, from the Westside Road trailhead to South 
Puyallup River Camp, separately as [SouthPuyallupPipeOrgan]. Once on the Wonderland 
you'll switchback steeply uphill, onto a ridge above the trees with great views to the 
south, then descend slightly to St. Andrews Lake.

From St. Andrews Lake to Klapatche Park is a fairly level 3/4 mile. The water source at 
Klapatche is Aurora Lake, which is notorious for drying up toward the end of the summer, 
shrinking to a muddy puddle wriggling with tadpoles. You'll probably want to carry water 
from St. Andrews Lake unless it's early in the season.

Once at Klapatche, sit by Aurora Lake and gaze at the mountain framed so nicely behind 
it. Two of the four campsites can even see the summit (such as it is on this western side 
of the mountain, which looks strangely collapsed lacking the usual summit cone) from 
inside your tent! Or if you turn 180&deg;, the ground drops away below Klapatche Ridge 
with views reaching all the way to Seattle on a clear day. Just don't overshoot when 
returning to your tent after a midnight toilet trip, or it'd be you that's dropping away 
:-)

The St. Andrews Creek Trail is less dramatic than the South Puyallup / Wonderland route 
to Klapatche, offering only peek-a-views from forest. It descends along the top of 
Klapatche Ridge, then switchbacks down a very steep hillside, ironically only meeting up 
with its namesake where the trail ends at the Westside Road. Although well maintained, 
this remote path is so little used that there were wildflowers attempting to grow 
directly on it. Apologies to those I trod on.

Near the St. Andrews Creek / Westside Road junction, a pleasant 1/4 mile side loop leads 
to Denman Falls. The viewpoint is partially obstructed, but it's worth visiting if you're 
in the area with time to spare.
