I've day hiked to Spray Park many times, but this was my first time doing the full loop.  I hiked it counterclockwise, overnighting at Ipsut Creek Camp.

What a stunning loop this is!  Incredible variety of scenery, covering multiple types of forest (including full temperate rainforest), alpine wildflower meadows, high altitude rockeries, snowfields, waterfalls, babbling brooks, the devastation of a glacier-fed river valley, craggy cliffs, and a suspension bridge.

Wildflowers are late this year due to the cold weather.  There are a ton of avalanche lilies in Spray Park, but not much else out yet.

There is a tree down across the trail on the descent from Seattle Park to Cataract Valley, and another on the climb up to Ipsut Pass, but easy enough to step over.  Also quite a bit of mud along the descent out of Seattle Park.

I suspect the snowfields at the top of Spray Park are pretty much year round? They are sizeable but easy to cross - no special equipment needed by this time of year.  The route is well trodden, and cairns are frequent.  Only gotcha is there's a big clear boot track heading up toward Observation Rock, which was throwing people off.  If in doubt, head downhill rather than up!

There were a LOT of bugs in Spray Park, but not yet so voracious that they wouldn't respect the power of DEET.   On the plus side, I watched the bugs drive away a couple of hikers who had been trompling meadows: I overhead them deciding to head back down to escape the mosquitos just as I was heading their way to ask them to please stay on the trail :-)

That final climb up to Ipsut Pass was brutal.

Bonus: I finally figured out why it is that parking at Mowich Lake always seems such an overcrowded cluster, yet things mellow out as soon as you hit the Spray Park trail.  It's because the crowds are headed up to Tolmie Peak instead...
