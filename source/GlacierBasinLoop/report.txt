[Uphill.jpg] Along the connecting trail between Glacier Basin and Burroughs Mountain

This loop combines the [GlacierBasin], [BurroughsMountain], and 
[WhiteRiverToSunrise] trails:

<ul>
<li>Start at White River.</li>
<li>Hike up the trail to Glacier Basin.</li>
<li>Shortly before reaching Glacier Basin proper, turn right onto a 1.5 mile connecting trail, climbing steeply to the saddle in between Second Burroughs and Third Burroughs.</li>
<li>Turn right onto the Burroughs Mountain trail, heading toward Sunrise.</li>
<li>When this intersects the Wonderland Trail, pass Shadow Lake and drop steeply down the Wonderland back to White River.</li>
</ul>

Dense forests, high meadows, alpine tundra, rivers, lakes, and expansive 
views of glaciers and mountain: this loop really has it all.

There are many options to increase the length. You could continue on to the 
Glacier Basin campsite (in fact I'd say you'd be crazy not to, as it makes a 
great spot for a second breakfast!) and perhaps head further up that basin. You 
could also head left rather than right from the Burroughs saddle, taking in 
Third Burroughs as well as Second and First.

An important choice is which direction to hike the loop. I went clockwise, 
which gave a nice progression of gradient (gentle up, steep up, gentle down, 
steep down), and left time for morning clouds to burn off before the views 
opened up during the high part of the hike. But this also meant I was facing 
away from the mountain during the viewtastic portion, and I hit the most 
crowded part of the popular Burroughs trail at the busiest time of midday. 
An alternative would be to start at Sunrise and hike counterclockwise, but 
ending a long hike with the climb back up from White River to Sunrise would 
be brutal. Next time I'm thinking about parking at White River while going 
counterclockwise, timing my start so I make it up to views while there's 
still dawn light on the mountain and not yet too many people around.
