This is a little-known gem among the many trails above Paradise, offering a close-up 
glacier experience without crowds to distract you from the stunning views.

Take your pick of routes through the maze of paved trails above Paradise, aiming 
northwestish toward the one named Dead Horse Creek Trail. 0.7 miles from the parking lot, 
the unpaved and easily missed Moraine Trail turns off to the left. This is only 
officially maintained for its first 0.1 mile, but the unmaintained part is easy to follow 
although wet and rocky in places. I recommend going right where the path splits, as both 
forks lead to the same place but the righthand one offers better footing.

The trail descends into the valley of the Nisqually Glacier, ending on the ridge of a 
dramatic lateral moraine. This is a huge mound of loose dust and rocks, piled up by the 
glacier of years gone by (the Nisqually has retreated nearly a mile over the last 150 
years). Enjoy the views of moraine, glacier, and mountain, but be careful on the edge of 
the moraine which is steep and loose underfoot!
