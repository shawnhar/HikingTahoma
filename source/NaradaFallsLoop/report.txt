Q: what do you get if you combine the Narada Falls Trail, High Lakes Trail, eastern 
portion of the [LakesLoop] including the Faraway Rock viewpoint, and the section of 
[Wonderland] from Reflection Lakes to Narada Falls?

A: a nice loop hike featuring many waterfalls, subalpine meadows and forest, occasional 
glimpses of the summit or Tatoosh mountains, plus one of Rainier's most iconic lakes.

Narada Falls and Reflection Lakes are easily accessible to non-hikers, and 
correspondingly heaving with the kind of crowds that make me start to doubt my belief 
that it's a good thing for the special places of this world to be accessible to all :-) 
The rest of this hike is surprisingly quiet, though. Several trail sections are near 
roads, but the frequent waterfalls do wonders to cover up traffic noise.

You can start the loop from either Narada Falls or Reflection Lakes. I went clockwise 
from Narada Falls, where it took me a moment to find the start of the trail (turns out 
it's just past the restroom building).
