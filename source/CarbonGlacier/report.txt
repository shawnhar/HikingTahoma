I hiked from the Carbon River entrance up to the foot of the Carbon Glacier, and across the suspension bridge to Carbon River Camp where I had lunch, then back to Ipsut Creek Camp where I spent the night.  Perfect weather, and the trails were all in good condition with well maintained bridges where needed (and in many cases where not, as water flow wasn't particularly high this weekend).

I've seen many comments about the lower section of this trail (which used to be a road up until the 2006 floods) being boring, but cannot agree.  This is not panoramic vistas, but gorgeous lush rainforest.  Lovers of green will find much to appreciate here.  I found the stark contrasts between verdant foliage and the rocky destruction of the Carbon River valley particularly appealing.

The first five miles of ex-road is fast hiking.  Higher up, gradient increases, speed decreases correspondingly, occasional views open up, and wildflowers are out near the glacier.  Saw a bear near the suspension bridge.

Strongly recommend finding time for the side trip to Chenuis Falls - stunning!
