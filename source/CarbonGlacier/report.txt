Hike along the relatively flat [CarbonRiver] trail through magnificent old 
growth rainforest, then more steeply uphill to a viewpoint of the Carbon 
Glacier. This is the longest, thickest, and lowest elevation of all glaciers 
in the contiguous United States.

Stronger hikers could do this in a day, but I snagged a walkup permit for 
Ipsut Creek Camp, giving me a 12.8 mile first day and 5 mile second.

Past Ipsut Creek, you join a section of the Wonderland Trail. The fork where 
you head left toward Carbon River Camp rather than right to Ipsut Pass is a 
very special spot: this is the lowest elevation of the entire Wonderland.

The trail follows the west side of the valley for a couple of miles, then 
crosses the Carbon River, joining up with the Northern Loop and running 
along the east side of the valley for another mile. Once upon a time the 
Wonderland used to continue along the west side here, but that has become 
yet another casualty of the destructive power of the Carbon River.

Shortly before reaching the glacier, you'll come to a suspension bridge over 
the Carbon River. I guess the Park Service got fed up of endlessly replacing 
log bridges at this spot? There's no need to cross here, but it is fun 
(although given my fear of heights a bit scary) to do so. Carbon River Camp 
is near the other side of the bridge.

There is no particular end to this trail. Enjoy the glacier views, turn 
around when you are done, keep going on up to Dick Creek Camp, or stay on 
the Wonderland another 13 miles all the way to Sunrise, it's up to you!
