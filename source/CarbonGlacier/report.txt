Hike or bike through magnificent old growth rainforest along the relatively 
flat [CarbonRiver] trail, then hike more steeply uphill to a viewpoint of 
the Carbon Glacier. This is the longest, thickest, and lowest elevation of 
all glaciers in the contiguous United States.

Stronger hikers could do this in a day, but I snagged a walkup permit for 
Ipsut Creek Camp, giving me a 12.8 mile first day and 5 mile second.

The trail joins up with the [Wonderland] shortly past Ipsut Falls. The fork 
where you head left toward Carbon River Camp rather than right to Ipsut Pass 
is a very special spot: this is the lowest elevation of the entire 
Wonderland.

From here the trail follows the west side of the valley for a couple of 
miles, then crosses the Carbon River on a log bridge, joining up with the 
[NorthernLoop] and running along the east of the valley for another mile. 
Once upon a time the Wonderland used to continue up the west side here, but 
that has become yet another casualty of the destructive power of the Carbon 
River.

Shortly before reaching the glacier, you'll come to a suspension bridge 
crossing back over to the west side of the Carbon River. I guess the Park 
Service got fed up of endlessly replacing log bridges at this location? 
There's no need to cross, but it is fun (although given my fear of heights a 
bit scary) to do so. Carbon River Camp is near the far side of this bridge.

There is no specific end to this hike. Enjoy the glacier views, turn around 
when you are done, keep hiking on up to Dick Creek Camp, or stay on the 
Wonderland another 13 miles all the way to Sunrise, it's up to you!
