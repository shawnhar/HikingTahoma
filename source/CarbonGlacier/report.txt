Hike or bike through magnificent old growth rainforest along the relatively 
flat [CarbonRiver] trail, then hike more steeply uphill to a viewpoint of 
the Carbon Glacier. This is the longest, thickest, and lowest elevation of 
all glaciers in the contiguous United States.

Stronger hikers could do this in a day, but I snagged a walkup permit for 
Ipsut Creek Camp, giving me a 12.8 mile first day and 5 mile second.

The trail joins up with the [Wonderland] shortly past Ipsut Falls. The fork 
where you head left toward Carbon River Camp rather than right to Ipsut Pass 
is a very special spot: this is the lowest elevation of the entire 
Wonderland.

From here the trail follows the west side of the valley for a couple of 
miles, then crosses the Carbon River, joining up with the [NorthernLoop] and 
running along the east of the valley for another mile. Once upon a time the 
Wonderland used to continue along the west side here, but that has become 
yet another casualty of the destructive power of the Carbon River.

Shortly before reaching the glacier, you'll come to a suspension bridge over 
the Carbon River. I guess the Park Service got fed up of endlessly replacing 
log bridges at this location? There's no need to cross, but it is fun 
(although given my fear of heights a bit scary) to do so. Carbon River Camp 
is near the other side of the bridge.

There is no specific end to this hike. Enjoy the glacier views, turn around 
when you are done, keep hiking on up to Dick Creek Camp, or stay on the 
Wonderland another 13 miles all the way to Sunrise, it's up to you!
