This is the longer, steeper, and more scenic of the two ways to reach Owyhigh Lakes as a 
day hike. If you want to get there in a hurry, go via [OwyhighLakesFromWhiteRiverRoad] 
instead. Or if you can arrange for a car at both ends, combine both trails as a 
through-hike.

The trailhead along WA 123 is unassuming and easily missed. The first 0.4 miles descends 
quite steeply, and you know what that means, Dear Reader: a kick in the teeth will be 
waiting for you at the end of the hike!

Most of the trail is a gradual climb through forest. It's the joyful kind of forest found 
on the eastern side of Rainier, with sparse enough trees that plenty of light makes it 
down to the forest floor, resulting in happily verdant undergrowth.

Water is a theme here. The area contains a multitude of streams and creeks, each of which 
flows over many waterfalls. White noise is a constant companion, shifting in volume and 
frequency as you grow closer to one falls or another. Notable examples are Deer Creek 
Falls near the start of the hike, crossing Deer Creek and Chinook Creek, Boundary Creek 
Falls, and Kotsuck Falls. That last lacks a good viewpoint, but seems impressive when 
glimpsed in the distance between trees, and it made my butt clench where a narrow few 
feet of trail hugs a cliff above it.

Higher up, forest gives way to a series of open meadows. There are no summit views here, 
but that's more than made up for by approaching and then passing below the dramatic 
Cowlitz Chimneys. These are a group of four rhyolite towers, remnants of an ancient 
volcanic plug. They're attractive and geologically fascinating.
