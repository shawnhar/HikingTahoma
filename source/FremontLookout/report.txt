This is the easiest to reach of Rainier's four remaining fire lookouts (the others being 
[GobblersKnob], [ShrinerPeak], and [TolmiePeak]) and I think offers the best views of 
them all. It's correspondingly popular and busy. Possible strategies for avoiding crowds 
include:

<ul>
<li>Come on a weekday.</li>
<li>Arrive early (it makes a great dawn hike).</li>
<li>Visit while SR410 is closed due to wildfires, so getting here from the Seattle urban area requires driving the long way all around the mountain.</li>
</ul>

I combined all three, and there were <i>still</i> a few people ahead of me on the trail!

Starting from Sunrise, you have multiple options for getting to the five way junction at 
Frozen Lake. Head north and then west along Sourdough Ridge for the most dramatic views, 
or south and then west joining the [Wonderland] and passing Shadow Lake for a bit 
more distance through mellow meadows, or due west for the easiest hike partially along a 
road. Of course you can make a loop of this part (I went out along Sourdough Ridge, then 
returned past Shadow Lake).

At Frozen Lake you will see Mount Fremont looming above you to the north, with the trail 
traversing up its western side. It's a gradual climb, skirting below the summit of Mount 
Fremont, becoming rocky as you cross steep scree slopes (the path is solid and well made, 
but exposed enough that I would not enjoy this in windy or icy conditions), and then 
arriving on top of the ridge where the lookout is located.

There are great views the whole way along this hike, but those from the lookout are just 
silly. There's Rainier behind you of course, but also Grand Park and the valley of the 
West Fork White River spread out below, and on a clear day you can see all of Mount 
Baker, the North Cascades, Puget Sound, and the Olympic Mountains.
