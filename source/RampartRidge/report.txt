Rampart Ridge is a straightforward loop hike starting from Longmire. Its 
eastern side is also the start of the [IndianHenrysFromLongmire] Wonderland 
Trail section, plus [MildredPoint].

Most of the trail is through forest, which is splendidly lush and 
rainforesty at the lower elevations. Along the way there's a nice overlook 
of the buildings at Longmire, and a short open section with a great view up 
the valley of Kautz Creek toward Rainier's summit. I recommend hiking the 
loop clockwise so you'll be facing toward the mountain at this point.

Due to its lower altitude, this hike is sometimes accessible during the 
off-season when higher trails are snowed in. It also makes a good snowshoe 
route: just beware avalanche risk across the short open section.

The start of the Rampart Ridge trail doubles as the beginning of the 0.7 
mile Trail of the Shadows, which circles around a marsh past several mineral 
springs and remnants of the historical Longmire Springs Hotel. This was 
constructed in 1890 before the creation of the National Park, and largely 
dismantled in 1920. Leftovers include an old log cabin, and rock walls built 
around several of the hot springs.
