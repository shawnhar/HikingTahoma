Rampart Ridge is a straightforward loop hike beginning at Longmire. Its eastern 
side is also the start of the [IndianHenrysFromLongmire] [Wonderland] section, 
and of [MildredPoint]. It overlaps with part of [TrailOfTheShadows].

Most of the trail is through forest, which is splendidly lush and 
rainforesty at the lower elevations. Along the way there's a nice overlook 
of the buildings at Longmire, and a short open section with a great view up 
the valley of Kautz Creek toward Rainier's summit. I recommend hiking the 
loop clockwise so you'll be facing toward the best view at this spot.

Rampart Ridge is the remnant of a lava flow that ran down the top of existing 
ridges at a time when the valleys were full of glaciers. Along its sides are 
cliffs with distinctive rock patterns, formed when lava cooled rapidly after 
coming in contact with ice.

Due to its lower altitude, this hike is sometimes accessible during the 
off-season when higher trails are snowed in. It also makes a good snowshoe 
route: just beware avalanche risk across the short open section.
