Rampart Ridge is a straightforward loop hike beginning at Longmire. Its eastern 
side is also the start of the [IndianHenrysFromLongmire] [Wonderland] section, 
and of [MildredPoint]. It overlaps with part of [TrailOfTheShadows].

Most of the trail is through forest, which is splendidly lush and 
rainforesty at the lower elevations. Along the way there's a nice overlook 
of the buildings at Longmire, and a short open section with a great view up 
the valley of Kautz Creek toward Rainier's summit. I recommend hiking the 
loop clockwise so you'll be facing toward the best view at this spot.

Due to its lower altitude, this hike is sometimes accessible during the 
off-season when higher trails are snowed in. It also makes a good snowshoe 
route: just beware avalanche risk across the short open section.
