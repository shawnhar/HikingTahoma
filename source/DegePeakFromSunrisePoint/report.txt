This hike is short but quite steep, and packed with stunning views.

The first part of the trail follows the top of Sourdough Ridge, with 
expansive views to the north. Then the ridgeline shoots suddenly upward, 
leaving the trail to traverse diagonally up the south side of the ridge as 
Rainier gradually comes into view. Finally, from the summit of Dege Peak you 
will enjoy a 360 degree vista including Rainier's summit, the Emmons 
Glacier, Burroughs Mountain, Sunrise, and Grand Park.

The only downside to this trail is traffic noise, as the road to Sunrise 
follows a similar route just slightly below the trail.

Dege Peak can also be reached via the [DegePeakFromSunrise] trail to the 
west.
