Old growth lowland forests always put me in mind of fantasy novels:

<i>Once upon a time, the One Forest stretched across the entire land of Wah-Chin-Toon. 
Travelers could pass all the way from its northern border by the Pea-Shartz to the 
estuary of Kolum-Bier in the south, without ever setting foot beyond an unbroken canopy 
of green. Over years beyond the ken of mortal man, these trees had grown wise and 
powerful, passing the tales of all that happened within their realm from one generation 
to the next: pinecone to sapling, nursery log to root. But one day came strangers bearing 
axe, fire, and saw. The ancient forest proved no match for these foreign wizardries. Only 
scattered remnants of the One Forest still survive...</i>

Mount Rainier National Park preserves some of the finest old growth forest anywhere in 
the world. The Eastside Trail is longer and (mostly) flatter than other great forest 
trails, offering a unique opportunity to spend an extended period of time in this special 
ecosystem.

From its southern end by the popular [GroveOfThePatriarchs], the trail gains just 1300 
feet over 7 miles to an intersection near the start of the [OwyhighLakesFromDeerCreek] 
trail. You'll enjoy giant ancient trees, fascinating rotting logs and stumps, several 
waterfalls, and likely solitude once past Grove of the Patriarchs. A highlight is 
Ohanapecosh Falls, in the middle of this section, where the trail crosses a bridge 
immediately above a two-tiered waterfall.

North of Deer Creek, the trail changes character as it sets in for some serious climbing 
over its final few miles. No more lollygagging through lowland forest: you'll be puffing 
for breath as the ecosystem changes with elevation, then out into the subalpine as you 
reach WA 123 near Cayuse Pass. The trail continues climbing past the far side of the 
road, offers views of Yakima Peak, briefly encounters a switchback along WA 410, and 
finally ends at a junction with the [NachesPeakLoop] just south of Tipsoo Lake.

Due to the length of this trail, few will want to hike the whole thing out and back. 
Other options:

<ul>
    <li>Start at the south end by Grove of the Patriarchs, hike north to Ohanapecosh 
    Falls, then back. This is 7.9 miles with 1180' elevation gain.</li>

    <li>Start in the middle at the Deer Creek trailhead and hike south to Ohanapecosh 
    Falls. This is 6.8 miles roundtrip with 1200' gain.</li>

    <li>Drop a car at both ends and hike the whole trail one way, either uphill heading 
    north, which gives the figures shown at the top of this article, or north to south, 
    which has you rolling downhill the entire way.</li>

    <li>Extend it via the Eastside Loop or [EastsidePCTLoop].</li>
</ul>
