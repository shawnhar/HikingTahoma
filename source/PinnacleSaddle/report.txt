Viewed from Paradise, the Tatoosh Range looks like a jagged row of teeth reaching for the 
sky. Closer up, these mountains are revealed to be ancient, rotten rock, much older than 
Rainier itself. It's a heavily glaciated landscape of cliffs, cols, and scree.

Starting at Reflection Lakes and heading south, this trail is short but aggressively 
steep. The first half climbs through forest, then dramatic views open up as the footing 
changes from dirt to loose rock. The maintained trail ends at the saddle in between 
Pinnacle Peak and Plummer Peak, where there are views backward to Rainier, south to Mount 
Adams, and sideways to Tatoosh peaks including Pinnacle, Plummer, and Unicorn.

Climbers may wish to continue right to the top of Plummer Peak (an easy scramble) or left 
up Pinnacle Peak (more challenging). To the south lies the Butter Creek Research Natural 
Area which has been designated as a pristine natural area for ecological study, so please 
follow Leave No Trace principles and do not explore off-trail here.
