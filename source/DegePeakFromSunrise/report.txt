[FromDegePeak.jpg] View from Dege Peak

This hike requires you to do something unnatural. Start at Sunrise, head 
north up to Sourdough Ridge, but then turn your back on the stunning summit 
views and hike <i>away</i> from the mountain. The 360 degree views from Dege 
Peak are totally worth it though. Craggy volcanic rock formations and 
panoramic vistas in a condensed, easy-to-access format.

Bonus points if you have the mental fortitude to set your alarm clock for 
crazy early and arrive at Sunrise before the actual sun has risen. I've done 
this twice now, and both times it was an experience I'll never forget.

Dege Peak can also be reached via the [DegePeakFromSunrisePoint] trail to 
the east.
