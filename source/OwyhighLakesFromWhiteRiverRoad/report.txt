This trail follows a classic profile: climb through forest, then arrive at an open meadow 
containing a couple of shallow lakes backed by dramatic crags. Hikers in search of open views may 
find it disappointing, because the route is mostly forested with only a small area of 
meadow at the top, and no summit views. Lovers of woodland will find much to appreciate 
here, though. The path is wide, well graded, and offers just the right amount of spring 
to your step. The trees change as you gain altitude, so you get to enjoy the variety of 
passing through several different types of forest.

The trail skirts some distance above the lakes, but there is an unofficial path down if you 
continue past them before turning left.

The lakes make a natural turnaround for a day hike, but the trail continues another 4.8 miles, 
dropping 2600 feet to a trailhead along WA 123. If you can arrange two cars, this would make a 
great through-hike.
