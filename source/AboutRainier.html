<p class="heading">About Mount Rainier</p>
<div class="description">

<p>Mount Rainier is my favorite place to hike. It's a 14,411 foot active 
volcano and the most glaciated peak in the contiguous USA, featuring hundreds of 
miles of trails across an astonishing variety of terrain. Lush rainforests, 
subalpine wildflower meadows, alpine tundra, snowfields, glaciers, bizarre 
volcanic rock formations, wild woolly rivers, and a plethora of waterfalls can 
all be experienced within a single hike. Even when you are 'just' hiking 
through trees, constant changes in altitude plus the rain shadow difference 
between east and west sides of the mountain (east is drier, west very wet) means 
no two Rainier forests are the same.</p>

<p>And then there is the wildlife. I've seen deer, elk, mountain goats, marmots 
aplenty, mosquitoes by the bazillion, pikas, grouse, foxes, rabbits, and bear. 
Still waiting for a cougar encounter though! Before you panic about those last 
two: Rainier animals are used to hikers, and negative encounters vanishingly 
rare. Treat them with respect, avoid surprising them, keep your food out of 
their way, and you won't have any trouble.</p>

<p>Hiking trails vary from easy to access and popular (aka crowded...) to 
obscure and remote. Trails are generally well maintained and signposted, so 
navigation is not difficult. A major exception is if you're travelling over 
snowfields, such as to Camp Muir, over Panhandle Gap or Spray Park before they 
melt out, or hiking early/late in the season. Do not hike over snow unless you 
are prepared to navigate through a white-out, or to hunker down and wait if the 
weather turns on you! It's a true saying that the mountain makes its own 
weather, and people have died from underestimating what this means at high 
altitude.</p>

<p>Another potential risk, mostly affecting backpackers, can be the more remote 
river crossings. Bridges are prone to washing away, and glacial meltwater can 
be challenging to ford if you want to cross before the Park Service gets around 
to replacing them.</p>

<p>Rainier is at its best between July and September. There can also be great 
hiking in the rump seasons of May, June, October, and November, but these 
months require more research, self sufficiency and attention to weather 
forecasts. The road up to Paradise is kept plowed during the winter, so high 
altitude snow sports remain accessible all year.</p>

<p>This region is overflowing with history. Starting with the name of the 
mountain itself, there is a
<a href="https://crosscut.com/2019/04/why-mount-rainier-was-once-called-mount-tacoma">fascinating debate</a>
over whether it should be Rainier, Tacoma, or Tahoma. Within the park there are 
beautiful place names (Mowich Lake, Ohanapecosh River, Wauhaukaupauken Falls) 
and also some that make me cringe (Indian Bar, Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds, 
and the especially inappropriate Squaw Lake). I like to take a moment at these 
beautiful places to think about the not-so-beautiful history that came before 
me, acknowledging the people whose land this once was.</p>


<p class="heading">Access</p>

<p>There are four entrances to the park: Nisqually (which leads to Longmire and 
Paradise) at the southwest, a northeast entrance leading to White River and 
Sunrise, Carbon River / Mowich Lake at the northwest, and the southeast Stevens 
Canyon entrance.</p>

<p>A fee is required to enter the National Park. If you plan on visiting more 
than once, it's much cheaper to buy an annual pass. Or if you only plan on 
visiting once, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??? :-)</p>

<p>Dogs are not allowed on any trails inside the National Park.</p>

<p>Parking spaces tend to fill up early, and waiting lines at the park 
entrances can be long on sunny summer weekends. I highly recommend arriving 
early to skip the crowds, find solitude on the trail, and boost your chances of 
seeing wildlife. Some of my most treasured memories are from hikes where I 
arrived at Sunrise as early as 4 AM, then watched the sun come up around me 
while already on the trail.</p>


<p class="heading">Backpacking</p>

<p>The epic Wonderland Trail (over 90 miles circumnavigating the mountain) is 
of course the jewel in Rainier's backpacking crown, but there are also many 
options for shorter loops or section hikes. Backpacking on Rainier can feel 
remote (few other people, a long way from road access) but also strangely tame 
as there are designated campsites with maintained pit toilets and bear poles 
for hanging your food.</p>

<p>Permits are required to camp on Rainier, because designated campsites means 
there are only a fixed number of spaces to go around. The normal system is that 
2/3 of available capacity is allocated through a lottery during March, while 
1/3 is held in reserve for walkup permits which are issued on a 
first-come-first-served basis to anyone who arrives in person at a ranger 
station for a trip starting that day or the day after. Some years are 
different, though. In 2016, all permits were walkup due to a software problem. 
In 2020, all permits were issued in advance due to the COVID pandemic.</p>
