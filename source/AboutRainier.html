<p class="heading">About Mount Rainier</p>
<div class="description">

<p>Mount Rainier is my favorite place to hike. It's a 14,411 foot volcano 
featuring an astonishing diversity of terrain. Lush forests, wildflower 
meadows, alpine tundra, snowfields, glaciers, bizarre volcanic rock formations, 
wild woolly rivers, and a plethora of waterfalls can all be experienced within 
a single hike. Even when you are 'just' hiking through trees, constant changes 
in altitude plus the rain shadow difference between east and west sides of the 
mountain (east is drier, west very wet) mean no two Rainier forests are the 
same.</p>

<p>And then there are the animals. I've seen deer, elk, marmots aplenty, 
grouse, foxes, rabbits, and bear. Still waiting for a cougar encounter though! 
Before you panic about those last two: Rainier animals are used to hikers, and 
negative encounters vanishingly rare. Treat them with respect, avoid surprising 
them, keep your food out of their way, and you won't have any trouble.</p>

<p>Hiking trails vary from popular (aka massively crowded) and easy to access, 
to obscure and remote. Trails are generally well maintained and signposted, so 
navigation is not difficult. A major exception is if you're travelling over 
snowfields, such as to Camp Muir, over Panhandle Gap or Spray Park before they 
melt out, or hiking early/late in the season. Do not hike over snow unless you 
are prepared to navigate through a white-out, or to hunker down and wait if the 
weather turns on you! It's a true saying that the mountain makes its own 
weather, and people have died from underestimating what that means at high 
altitude.</p>

<p>Another potential risk (which mostly affects backpackers) is the more remote 
river crossings, where bridges are prone to washing away and glacial meltwater 
can be challenging to ford if you want to cross before the park service gets 
around to replacing them.</p>

<p>Rainier is at its best between July and September. There can also be 
great hiking in the rump seasons of May, June, October, and November, but 
these months require more self sufficiency and attention to weather 
forecasts. The road up to Paradise is kept ploughed during the winter, so 
high altitude snow sports remain accessible all year.</p>

<p>This place is crammed with history. Starting with the name of the 
mountain itself: there is a fascinating debate over whether it should be 
Rainier or Tahoma. Within the park there are beautiful place names (Mowich 
Lake, Ohanapecosh River, Wauhaukaupauken Falls) and also some that make me 
cringe (Indian Bar, Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds, and the especially 
inappropriate Squaw Lake). I like to take a moment at these beautiful places 
to think about the not-so-beautiful history that came before me, and 
acknowledge the people whose land this once was.</p>


<p class="heading">Access</p>

<p>There are four entrances to the park: Nisqually (which leads to Longmire and 
Paradise) at the southwest, a northeast entrance leading to White River and 
Sunrise, Carbon River (leading to Mowich Lake) at the northwest, and the 
southeast Stevens Canyon entrance.</p>

<p>A fee is required to enter the National Park. If you plan on visiting more 
than once, it's much cheaper to buy an annual pass. Or if you only plan on 
visiting once, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??? :-)</p>

<p>Parking spaces tend to fill up early, and waiting lines at the park 
entrances can be long on sunny summer weekends. I highly recommend arriving 
early to skip the crowds, find solitude on the trail, and boost your chances of 
seeing wildlife. Some of my most treasured memories are from hikes where I 
arrived at Sunrise as early as 4 AM, then watched the sun come up around me 
while already on the trail.</p>


<p class="heading">Backpacking</p>

<p>The epic Wonderland Trail (90+ miles circumnavigating the mountain) is of 
course the jewel in Rainier's backpacking crown, but there are also many 
options for shorter loops or section hikes. Backpacking on Rainier can feel 
remote (few other people, a long way from road access) but also strangely tame 
as there are designated campsites with maintained pit toilets and bear poles 
for hanging your food.</p>

<p>Permits are required to camp on Rainier (because with designated campsites, 
there are only a fixed number of spaces to go around). The normal system is 
that 2/3 of available capacity is allocated through a lottery during March, 
while 1/3 is held in reserve for walkup permits, which are issued on a 
first-come-first-served basis to anyone who arrives in person at a ranger 
station for a trip starting that day or the day after. Some years are 
different, though. In 2016, all permits were walkup due to a software problem. 
In 2020, all permits were issued in advance due to the COVID pandemic.</p>
