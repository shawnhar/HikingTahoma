[vista.jpg] Viewpoint overlooking the snout of the Nisqually Glacier

Depending on your perspective, this is either a wheelchair accessible trail that's 
slightly more challenging than [MyrtleFalls], or a way to experience the Nisqually 
Glacier that's much tamer than the [MoraineTrail]. It's a fully paved lollipop loop, 
starting at Paradise and passing through subalpine meadows and forest on the way to a 
series of (safely fenced) viewpoints along a cliff overlooking the Nisqually Valley. From 
here you have a great view of the mountain, the crevassed upper reaches of the glacier, 
its rock-covered lower section, the river flowing from its mouth, and the dramatic valley 
where the glacier used to be before retreating nearly a mile over the last 150 years.
