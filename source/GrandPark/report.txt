Grand Park is a unique geological formation created by [something mumble 
lava flow ok I admit I don't really know]. It's a large (mile long, half 
mile wide) open space, perfectly flat and devoid of trees. It looks 
manicured, as if a Jane Austen character might appear at any moment taking 
their promenade around the manor grounds.

At the right time of year this park is full of wildflowers. It provides 
beautifully framed Rainier summit views when the weather cooperates. It's 
also famous for wildlife sightings (in my case, a herd of elk).

The hike starts at Sunrise. Head along Sourdough Ridge to Frozen Lake, then 
along a section of the Wonderland Trail through a desolate tundra landscape 
below the cliffs of Burroughs Mountain. Slightly under a mile from Frozen 
Lake, turn north onto the Northern Loop trail, which descends through the 
delightful and lush Berkeley Park. The trail parallels the babbling Lodi 
Creek, eventually dropping below the tree line near the Berkeley Park 
backcountry campsite. Be sure to refill waterbottles before leaving Lodi 
Creek, as there is no reliable water source at Grand Park. After more 
descent through forest, the trail climbs through an area that was 
overflowing with ridiculous amounts of bear grass when I hiked it. The 
forest gives way to meadows, with a spur trail to the right taking you into 
the center of Grand Park.

(if you go left here instead, that's the Northern Loop, which is a story for 
another day)

You can also reach Grand Park from the north via Lake Eleanor, which is 
shorter but less scenic than the route I took from Sunrise.
