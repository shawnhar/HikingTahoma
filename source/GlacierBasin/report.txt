This hike is reported elsewhere as being significantly shorter than the 
numbers I'm giving above. Usually more like 6 miles with 1600' elevation 
gain.

That's what happens if you start at the White River campsite, hike up 
alongside the Inter Fork of the White River, and turn around at the 'End of 
Maintained Trail' sign by the Glacier Basin backcountry camp. It's a 
pleasant enough hike, through varied forest with occasional more open views, 
and the high basin at the end of the trail is quite beautiful.

You're really missing the point if this is all you do here, though. Far 
greater rewards are to be had by going further.

A mile from the trailhead there's a side spur to the left signposted Emmons 
Moraine. Skipping this would cut out 2 miles and 500' elevation gain, but 
it's well worth exploring. Emmons Glacier is a monster (largest surface area 
of any glacier in the contiguous United States!) and this is the perfect 
place to see it from. You can usually also see a lake filled by Emmons 
meltwater, which is colored turquoise by suspended glacial silt. I find it 
amazing to think how this water was only recently liberated from hundreds of 
years of deep freeze within a glacier, during which time it was slowly 
grinding rock down to ever finer grades of silt.

Better still, after you reach the end of the official trail at the entrance 
to Glacier Basin, an unofficial but easy to follow climbers trail continues 
upward through the basin. It passes a small moraine on its way to the base 
of the Inter Glacier, at which point it becomes a summit climbing route 
requiring special equipment and skills. Don't venture onto the glacier if 
you lack these, but do continue up the basin as far as you want. It's super 
cool: my favorite part of this trail.

The Glacier Basin trail also forms part of the [GlacierBasinLoop].
