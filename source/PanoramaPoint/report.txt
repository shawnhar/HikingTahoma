Only one of the network of paths above Paradise is officially named the Skyline 
Trail, but I view them all as combining to form one big multiple-choice hike. 
You start at Paradise, pick one of several options heading uphill to the 
viewpoint at Panorama Point, then choose a different route back down, making a 
loop. This can be repeated many times without going the exact same way twice.

This area is a riot of wildflowers during the summer. It's all above the tree 
line, so in-your-face views of Rainier's summit start before you've even left 
the parking lot. You'll also see the Tatoosh Range to the south, the Nisqually 
Glacier and river valley, a couple of waterfalls, the occasional climber with 
ice ax strapped to their pack (this is the start of the most popular summit 
route), and other hikers. So many other hikers! I am clearly far from alone in 
thinking this trail is great :-)

I'll describe the main route choices going clockwise, but of course this loop 
can be hiked in either direction.

The first half mile of trail is paved, and usually full of small children 
enjoying their first hike. As you head north from Paradise, you can 
optionally detour to the right over the top of a knoll called Alta Vista, 
and/or a little further up detour to the left (signposted Glacier Vista) for 
a tasty overlook above the Nisqually Valley.

After a mile and a half the trail bends sharply to the right and traverses 
diagonally up a slope. There's a turnoff to the left signposted Pebble Creek, 
which bypasses Panorama Point as a shortcut to the top of the High Skyline. 
Ignore it, and continue a quarter mile to Panorama Point. At 6750' 
elevation, this exposed viewpoint offers, well, panoramic views? (sorry but 
it had to be done) of the Tatoosh Range, and on a clear day also the distant 
volcanoes Mount Adams and St. Helens. It's a perfect spot for lunch.

Past Panorama Point you have two choices (or I guess three, as you could just 
go back the way you came). The Low Skyline trail heads east across a slope 
that can be snow covered until late in the season, and is sometimes roped 
off by the Park Service due to avalanche hazard. Alternatively the High 
Skyline heads north, then east, then back south again, adding some distance 
and an extra 250' elevation gain, but is safer in snowy conditions. Just 
don't keep walking north forever, or you'll end up at [CampMuir]!

After the High and Low Skyline trails rejoin, head downhill to the south before 
arriving at one last decision point: turn southwest along the Golden Gate trail 
for the shortest route home, or southeast, remaining on the official Skyline 
trail, for a longer hike passing near the inaccessible Sluiskin Falls (which 
can be viewed from the road but not reached by trail). Shortly before the falls 
comes the option of further extending your hike by adding in the 
[ParadiseGlacier] trail.

Near Sluiskin Falls, a bench marks the spot where Sluiskin, a Native American 
(probably Taidnapam) guide, waited while Hazard Stevens and Philemon van Trump 
made the first documented summit of Mount Rainier. I find many accounts of this 
tale uncomfortably racist, as they infantilize the 'superstitious' fear with 
which Sluiskin warned of the powerful guardian who dwelt on the summit in a 
lake of fire, and the astonishment with which he greeted the climbers on their 
successful return. It sounds to me like Sluiskin was sensibly worried that 
these explorers were taking a risk of which he understood more than they did, 
not to mention the likelihood that he'd be blamed should he return without them!

The Golden Gate and Skyline options rejoin shortly before [MyrtleFalls], after 
which the paving resumes, crowd density increases, and it's a gentle stroll 
back to Paradise.

This loop can also be accessed via the 0.25 mile 4th Crossing trail, which 
connects the Paradise Valley road to the Skyline in between Myrtle and Sluiskin 
Falls. It's a nice quiet trailhead if you want to avoid the chaos of Paradise 
proper.

This area provides gorgeous snowshoeing during winter, but beware of avalanche 
risk on the steeper slopes.
