15 miles is an awfully long way for any waterfall, especially one like this where much of 
the distance is fairly boring closed-to-cars road, plus the viewpoint of the falls is 
partially obstructed! Visiting here is more practical if you bike up the Westside Road, or 
if you already happen to be passing by on your way to [KlapatchePark] or [NorthPuyallup].

The falls are reached along a pleasant 1/4 mile forested loop trail, the two ends of 
which start from the Westside Road either side of where it crosses St. Andrews Creek. 
This is presumably a remnant of when the road used to be open to cars, at which time 
Denman Falls was an easily accessible family destination, because simply viewing the 
falls did not require bothering to build the trail as a loop.

An abandoned but still visible path continues past the Denman Falls viewpoint, I believe 
down to Larrupin and Ethania Falls. I was tired, so left exploring that for another day.
