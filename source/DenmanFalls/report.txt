15 miles is an awfully long way to go for any waterfall, especially one like this where much of 
the distance is fairly boring closed-to-cars road, not to mention the viewpoint of the 
falls is partially obstructed. Visiting here is more practical if you bike up the 
Westside Road or already happen to be passing by on your way to [KlapatchePark] or 
[NorthPuyallup].

Denman Falls is reached along a pleasant 1/4 mile forested loop trail, the two ends of 
which start from the Westside Road either side of where it crosses St. Andrews Creek. 
This is presumably a remnant from when the road used to be open to cars, at which time 
Denman Falls was an easily accessible family destination, because simply viewing the 
falls did not require bothering to build this trail as a loop.

Just past Denman Falls you will find a sign stating <i>"End Of Maintained Trail. Travel 
Safely. Leave No Trace"</i>. Signs like this usually mark where official trails 
transition to climber's paths (e.g. at Glacier Basin and Mirror Lake) or to unmaintained 
but tolerated-by-the-park routes (Moraine Trail, Van Trump Park). So I wondered, why is 
such a sign located here?

Research suggested that this trail might head downhill to Larrupin Falls and Ethania 
Falls, and could even have been the original route of the [Wonderland]. A
<a href="http://npshistory.com/brochures/mora/1919.pdf">1919 park brochure</a> includes a 
map that shows the Wonderland descending to the South Puyallup river valley at this 
location.

I explored the abandoned trail to Larrupin and Ethania Falls in 2023, and have to say, 
you should not bother coming here if you're chasing waterfalls. They are treed-in, and I 
did not find good enough viewpoints to get any photos worth sharing. Parts of the old 
trail still exist, but it is overgrown with trees in many places and covered with 
blowdowns in others. Navigationally challenging and not easy going. This is shown as the 
dotted line on the map above, and not included in the distance or elevation gain.

Having visited this old trail, I now strongly suspect that it was indeed the original 
route of the Wonderland. It was clearly abandoned a long time ago (fallen trees covering 
the path are in some cases so rotted that they disintegrate into sawdust the moment your 
foot touches them) yet the trail was once wide and it switchbacks down the hillside with 
a gentle gradient. I've hiked enough unofficial routes to know that climber's and 
fisherman's paths are much more direct about their ascents than this one. An old trail 
would only have been constructed with this kind of switchback is if it was intended for 
pack animals such as the horses that

depended on.
