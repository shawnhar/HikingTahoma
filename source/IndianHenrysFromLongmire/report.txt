For me at least, Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds is a place of romance and 
mystery.

It's on the remote west side of Mount Rainier, which is largely accessible only 
to backpackers. This is one of the few reasonable day hike destinations between 
Longmire and Mowich Lake.

It's also the first segment of the [Wonderland] to be experienced by many 
backpackers, as clockwise-starting-at-Longmire is the most popular Wonderland 
itinerary. I find it impossible to hike this trail without imagining the 
countless Wonderland adventures that have started here, and dreaming of the day 
when I too will take on that epic challenge. At the first serious uphill I 
think of all the backpackers who perhaps found themselves here wondering, did I 
really need to bring that extra foldable camp chair? :-)

And then there's the history. The destination of this hike is named after a 
Native American guide who assisted early white folks including John Muir, James 
Longmire and Philemon van Trump. His name was So-To-Lick, not Henry. He was 
most likely Nisqually, Cowlitz or Klickitat: definitely not from India. He may 
well have hunted here, but there were also rumors that he had a secret gold 
mine in the area. No sign of it has ever been found though. There's a story 
that his wives used to rest by the offensively named Squaw Lake while he hunted 
in the meadows above, but who in their right mind would choose to rest there? 
It's pretty and all, but SO many mosquitos!

Anyways. The trail starts at Longmire: park in the lot to the right of the road 
shortly after the main Longmire complex. Cross the road, and head north along 
the forested Wonderland Trail signposted Pyramid Creek and Devils Dream (ah, 
the romance of these names). Climb up to Rampart Ridge, ignoring the Van Trump 
trail turnoff on the right and Rampart Ridge trail on the left. Descend to the 
Kautz Creek valley, which (at least each time I've been here) contains a small 
trickle of water in the middle of a giant swathe of destruction that testifies 
to how not-small it can become when in the right mood. Follow cairns to find 
your way across the valley floor, then pass Pyramid Creek Camp and use the log 
bridges to cross Pyramid Creek. Now comes a serious climb, switchbacking up 
through forest, crossing Hornpipe Creek, switchbacking up some more through 
different forest, and eventually arriving at Devils Dream Camp, which turns out 
to be just a few flat spaces to pitch tents in the middle of the forest.

Shortly past the camp, views start to open up at Squaw Lake, which is a lovely 
area of trees and water and frogs. A little more climbing and you arrive at 
Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds. This is an open meadow containing a historic 
patrol cabin, framed in front of a Rainier perspective that you just can't get 
anywhere else. The cabin was built in 1915, and all these years later the porch 
is still a great place to eat lunch when it's raining.

If you have any gumption left, continue 0.2 miles to a turnoff on the right, 
which is a 0.5 mile spur to the photogenic Mirror Lakes.
