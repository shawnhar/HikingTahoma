This has got to be the most varied hike on Rainier:

<ul>

<li>Start up an old, unmaintained trail from the ranger cabin at Mowich Lake (facing from 
the lake toward the front steps of the cabin, it's to your left, and to the left of the 
path that accesses the ranger outhouse). It's steep, rooty, and rough: a good way to get 
most of the elevation gain of this hike out of the way early.</li>

<li>Enjoy as the terrain opens from forest into a world of meadows, streams and small 
waterfalls. It feels like an older cousin of Spray Park that grew up on the wrong side of 
the tracks: you can tell they are related, but this one hasn't shaved for a few days and 
you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of them.</li>

<li>Arrive at Knapsack Pass, which is a true take-your-breath-away moment. If you started 
early in the morning like me, you'll have been climbing in shadow this whole time, and 
without Rainier views. All of a sudden there's sun on your face and a volcano right in 
front of you!</li>

<li>The descent to the east of Knapsack Pass is an adventure. It's steep, and consists of 
loose scree where the path may not be obvious. When I visited the bottom 30 feet of this 
slope was still covered in snow, but it had a nice safe runout, perfect for a 
glissade.</li>

<li>Turning south you'll traverse below East Fay Peak, which is the source of a large 
talus field. Snowfields linger here through most of the year, so you may be clambering 
over boulders, hiking over snow, or both.</li>

<li>After skirting around the east flank of Mount Pleasant you'll enter upper Spray Park, 
which is a wonderland of wildflower meadows, summit views, meltwater ponds, and views to 
the north over Mist Park.</li>

<li>The Knapsack Pass trail ends upon joining the [SprayPark] trail. Turn right here and 
enjoy the glories of Spray Park on the way back to your car: some of the finest 
wildflower meadows on this planet followed by a descent into lush forest and the 
spectacular Spray Falls, on trail that's no longer unmaintained or lacking crowds of 
other hikers :-)</li>

</ul>

This is a hike, not a scramble, but it's on the scramblier end of things that count as 
hikes. Route-finding is challenging in places. There are no signposts identifying the 
several climbers trails that turn off toward Fay Peak, First Mother Mountain, Mount 
Pleasant, etc. The scree, talus, and snowfield sections may have no visible path to 
follow: I found no footprints ahead of me on the snow. Only come here if your navigation 
is solid.

Being a loop, of course you could also hike this counterclockwise, but that would be 
foolish. It's easier to get the steep parts out of the way early while you are fresh, and 
more soul-uplifting to have Tahoma in front of you for as much of the hike as possible.

Ending at Mowich Lake brings one final delight: what a lovely lake that is to swim in 
after hiking on a hot day.
