This unofficial route extends the [OwyhighLakesFromWhiteRiverRoad] or 
[OwyhighLakesFromDeerCreek] trails, adding a couple more miles, another 1370 feet 
elevation gain, and some stunning views. The figures shown above are approaching from 
White River Road (the easier option).

An unsignposted turnoff to the west of the Owyhigh Lakes trail is found a short distance 
south of the lakes. From here the path climbs steeply up an open slope, eschewing 
switchbacks. Don't forget to turn around at regular intervals to enjoy views of the 
Cowlitz Chimneys and south to Mount Adams. Upon reaching a saddle below the summit of 
Tamanos Mountain, a unique view of Rainier appears, with Goat Island Mountain to the 
right, the valley of Fryingpan Creek center stage, and Banshee Peak and the Sarvent 
Glacier on the left.

The saddle would be a fine place to turn around, or you can turn right and ascend a 
ridge to the summit of Tamanos Mountain. This starts out wide with a trail of loose dirt 
and dust, then turns rocky, and near the summit becomes a scramble with exposure beyond 
my comfort level, so I turned back a little before the top.

This trail is becoming eroded due to increasing popularity bringing more visitors than an 
unmaintained bootpath can properly support. Hiker feet have compacted fragile meadow 
soil, which then became a water drainage and created deep gullies. People are now 
starting to walk alongside rather than in these gullies, creating new paths that will 
repeat the same cycle, eventually turning a hillside of wildflowers into a maze of eroded 
footpaths.

There is an ongoing debate in Pacific Northwest hiker circles about how to deal with 
damage caused by the increasing popularity of hiking. Some argue that hidden gem routes 
should be kept secret, to avoid their overuse and subsequent destruction. I am firmly in 
the camp that believes information should be shared, yet I must admit I had some qualms 
about hiking and then documenting this particular route. Ultimately I see several 
possibilities, ideally used in combination, that would result in it being better cared 
for:

<ul>
<li>Trail crews could agree to maintain this excellent trail, giving it a more reasonable 
grading and drainage control.</li>
<li>We can visit it less. I feel good about having hiked this route once, but it's not a 
place I will choose to revisit often or bring large groups of friends to see.</li>
<li>When hiking here, we can be extra careful to minimize our impact. Step on rocks 
rather than dirt wherever possible, don't create new paths even where the established 
one is inconvenient, etc.</li>
</ul>
