[Marsh.jpg] Open marshy area, with the cliffs of Rampart Ridge behind
[Accessible.jpg] Going counterclockwise, the first part of this trail is wheelchair accessible (although the entire loop is not)
[Cabin.jpg] Historic cabin built by the Longmire family in 1888. Note the iron deposits and melted snow due to a mineral spring behind the cabin
[HotSprings.jpg] Back in the day the Longmire family built stonework around several mineral springs along the Trail of the Shadows, hoping to establish a spa. Their venture failed, but their construction remains. The springs aren't exactly hot, but warm enough to clear a gap in the snow

This easy trail circles through old growth forest around a marsh, past 
several mineral springs and remnants of the historical Longmire Springs 
Hotel. This was constructed by the Longmire family in 1890, before the 
creation of the National Park, and largely dismantled in 1920. Leftovers 
include an old log cabin, and rock walls built around several of the hot 
springs. Their plan to create a spa here didn't really make sense (the 
spring water isn't particularly hot, its minerals are just smelly rather 
than therapeutic, and their execution of the idea was, shall we say, not 
particularly polished) but nevertheless this is an important piece of 
Rainier history.
