The backcountry campsites at spectacular Indian Bar are some of the most 
desired, and correspondingly hard to score permits for, of any along the 
Wonderland Trail. This special place is also accessible as a long day hike 
from Box Canyon.

There are basically three parts to this trail: a steep climb through forest, 
a slightly less steep continuing climb up the ridge of Cowlitz Divide with 
increasingly stunning views in all directions, and then a descent with 
maximally stunning views into the basin of Indian Bar.

The bizarre thing about this trail is that as you drop down toward Indian 
Bar you will lose sight of Rainier's summit, but you won't care at all 
because the local views are <i>better than that</i>, if you can imagine such 
a thing. There's the Ohanapecosh River, and waterfalls descending cliffs all 
around, and the bridge over Wauhaukaupauken Falls, and... I lack the words. 
Just go there and experience it for yourself.

Possibly the best views of all are from the backcountry toilet, which is 
next to camp site #4. I recommend trying this out even if you don't 
particularly have to go. Best view I ever had while pooping! Sadly I have no 
photos, because who takes a camera while going to the bathroom?

There are no water sources along the Cowlitz Divide, so make sure to carry 
plenty, especially if you're planning on turning around at the top of 
Cowlitz Divide and skipping the final descent to Indian Bar itself.
