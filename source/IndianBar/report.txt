What could be better than taking a Wednesday off work to go hiking with a friend?

We had good weather (maybe a little too good: the climb got hot!) and the trail is in great condition. Enjoyed chatting with many Wonderlanders, but saw no other day hikers, which made us feel pleasingly badass :-)

Opinions vary as to the elevation gain of this hike. WTA has it at 3130 feet, while the National Park Service says 3700 and AllTrails claims 4773.  All I can say is it was a long way up, and then a long way back down again.  That last couple of miles did not make us feel particularly badass :-(

There are basically three parts to this trail: a steep climb through woods, a slightly less steep (but hotter) continuing climb up the Cowlitz Divide with increasingly stunning views, and then a drop down with maximally stunning views into Indian Bar.

Possibly the best views of all are from the backcountry toilet at Indian Bar, which is next to camp site #4.  Recommend trying this out even if you don't particularly have to go.  Best view I ever had while pooping!

Lupin are out in extraordinary numbers.  I never saw so many before, and had not previously realized they were a scented flower.  The aroma was lovely.

There is still water in one of the streams a half mile or so above Nickel Creek Camp, but it looks likely to dry up soon, after which there'll be none between Nickel Creek and Indian Bar.  Stock up well, especially if you're planning on turning around at the top of Cowlitz Divide and skipping the drop down to Indian Bar itself.  I say this because we had been reserving that as a bail-out option, only to realize it wasn't actually an option at all because we needed more water.
