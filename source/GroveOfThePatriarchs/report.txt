<span class="trailinfo">2022 update: Grove of the Patriarchs is inaccessible because a 
flood damaged the suspension bridge. No ETA for repair. The Silver Falls part of this 
hike is fine.</span>

This hike has the highest awesomeness/difficulty ratio of any at Rainier. It 
combines three easy trails, which can also be hiked separately:

<ul>
<li>Heading north from Ohanapecosh campground, the Silver Falls Loop is 2.8 miles with 750' elevation gain</li>
<li>Going south from the trailhead on Stevens Canyon Road, Silver Falls is 1.3 miles, 400'</li>
<li>North from the Stevens Canyon Road trailhead, Grove of the Patriarchs is 1.1 miles, 100'</li>
</ul>

Silver Falls is impressive, and the trail offers multiple excellent viewpoints of both 
the main falls and the series of rapids above it. So much spray and boiling water!

The loop that connects Silver Falls to Ohanapecosh campground heads up one side of the 
Ohanapecosh River and back down the other, but it's primarily a woodland rather than 
river hike. And what lovely woods these are: open and light. Of all the forests on 
Rainier, I vote for this one as most likely to contain elves. It's a place for laughter 
and singing.

Near Ohanapecosh campground, there are hot springs. Not big enough to bathe in, but it is 
interesting to experience bath-temperature water oozing out of rocks. There was once a 
concession here with hotel, cabins, and bathhouses run by the Ohanapecosh Hot Springs 
Company, but it was bought out and the buildings removed in 1961.

Ohanapecosh means 'standing at the edge' in the Sahaptin language of the Taidnapam. This 
was the name of a Taidnapam settlement a few miles outside the current National Park 
boundary.

At the other end of the route, Grove of the Patriarchs is a magical island in the middle 
of the Ohanapecosh River, accessed by a suspension bridge. This is home to giant Red 
Cedars, Douglas Fir, and Western Hemlocks, some more than a thousand years old. Tasteful 
wooden walkways have been constructed to protect the roots of these ancient trees from 
the crowds of tourists.

The Ohanapecosh is unique among Rainier's major rivers because it is fed entirely by 
meltwater from snowfields above Indian Bar, rather than by an active glacier. That means 
no silt, and no periodic lahars. The water runs crystal clear rather than the usual 
turbid gray, and it has nurtured these trees for millennia rather than destroying 
everything in its path as is the normal way of Rainier rivers.

If the Silver Falls Loop is inhabited by wood elves, I'm pretty sure this island is home 
to a powerful elf queen. Were I a hero on a perilous quest, I suspect she'd tell me I 
could rest here as long as needed, for no enemy may pass the enchanted waters of the 
Ohanapecosh. Then she'd give me some kind of item, telling me it was carved from a fallen 
branch of a wise old tree that had spent its life soaking up earthpower from this special 
river. Later on, that item would undoubtably save me from some unexpected peril.

It's just that kind of a place.

The low altitude and gentle gradient make this a potentially great winter or snowshoe 
hike. WA-123 is closed at the park entrance during winter, so you'll have to hike an 
extra mile each way along the road to reach the start of the trail at Ohanapecosh 
campground. When the snow gets deep, WA-123 closes all the way back at its junction with 
US 12, adding an additional 2.6 miles of road hiking each way. Be careful over the many 
bridges if you choose to hike this in deep snow conditions.
