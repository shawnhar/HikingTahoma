The Lakes Loop is kinda like a mirror image of the [PanoramaPoint] above 
Paradise. It starts in the same place, is also a loop, and enjoys similarly 
impressive wildflowers and mountain views, but heads south and downhill 
rather than north and uphill.

Going clockwise from Paradise, you'll start out on the eastern portion of the 
Skyline Trail, descend along Mazama Ridge to Faraway Rock which is a viewpoint 
above [LouiseLake], meet up with the road by the famous Reflection Lakes, and 
then climb back up to where you began.

In the summer Reflection Lakes is packed with cars and tourists, but neat 
trick: this loop also makes a great snowshoe trail. The road to Paradise is 
plowed all winter, so you can get up there to access the hike, but the road 
to Reflection Lakes is closed during the off-season so there will be few 
others at the lake. When snow is deep, the west side of this loop (from 
Paradise down to Reflection Lakes) will be flagged, but the east side (along 
Mazama Ridge) is unmarked. To minimize avalanche terrain, the most common 
winter route down Mazama Ridge starts up the 4th Crossing trail, hugs the 
western side of the ridge (unlike the summer trail), then hops across via the 
High Lakes route, bypassing Faraway Rock.

This loop can be shortened by taking the High Lakes trail to the north of 
Reflection Lakes, or extended by combining it with the [NaradaFallsLoop].
