This is an easy hike, short and with minimal elevation gain (although enough that it 
doesn't feel flat) yet plenty rewarding. The terrain is mostly open meadow right from the 
start, offering wildflowers and views of the surrounding peaks, which include the 
dramatic and romantically named Unicorn Peak.

Along the trail, an overgrown yet worthwhile side spur leads to Bench Lake, which clings 
improbably to the edge of a steep downward slope. It's the infinity pool of mountain 
lakes, with only a thin lip of rock holding the outer edge of the lake in place.

The trail ends at Snow Lake. There's a campsite by the north of the lake, and a large 
(scramblable) talus field next to a beautiful smaller pond just south of it.
