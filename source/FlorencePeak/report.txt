This is a grouchy, cantankerous trail. Hikers from the Seattle area will know what 
I mean when I say it partakes of much the same spirit as Mailbox Old Trail:

<ul>
<li>A ton of elevation gain in not that many miles.</li>
<li>Rough-and-ready ascent through forest with no views.</li>
<li>The whole way up you'll be telling yourself things get easier after you make it to the ridge, but they don't really :-)</li>
<li>Expansive views from the top.</li>
<li>Lower altitude trailhead and limited avalanche exposure make it a good off-season training hike, although there'll be plenty of snow higher up if you go outside of summer.</li>
</ul>

Hiking this trail was not strictly necessary to achieve my 
hike-all-maintained-trails-inside-Rainier-National-Park goal, because the maintained part 
of the trail lies outside the park, and even that is just a best effort by WTA 
volunteers. Much appreciation for the cleared blowdowns and occasional steps, but the 
roughness of this unofficial trail really makes me appreciate what a great job the MRNP 
trail crews do elsewhere!

The Boundary Trail starts from halfway around the Carbon River Rain Forest Nature Trail, 
right by the Carbon River entrance. Once upon a time this used to follow the park 
boundary south all the way to Mowich Lake Road, and some maps still show more southerly 
pieces of the trail, but most of it has fallen into disrepair. The section from Carbon 
River to Alki Crest, however, is clear and easily followed.

After 1.3 miles and 1250' gain, you'll cross a stream immediately below one waterfall and above 
another. Don't slip here! Keep on climbing, and 2.4 miles in (2780' gain) you will arrive 
at Alki Crest. The crest is a disappointing nonevent, as you've climbed so far yet the view 
is only trees. The Boundary Trail continues south, downhill from the crest before 
petering out, but instead you should turn left at the high point, onto the extremely 
unofficial and unsignposted Florence Peak trail. This heads southeast along the sometimes 
narrow ridge of Alki Crest, past a couple of deceptive surely-this-is-the-summit-nows, 
to...

... another false summit! Finally, after so much work, views open up. Carbon River to the 
north, so far below you. Rainier, of course. Mount St. Helens. This is a high enough 
spike of rock that all directions have interesting things to look at.

The true summit of Florence Peak is a short scramble further, but I opted to call it a 
day at the no-climbing-required false summit.
