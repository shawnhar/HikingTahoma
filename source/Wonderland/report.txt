The Wonderland Trail is a 93 mile loop circumnavigating Mount Rainier. Along the way it 
takes in many of the best examples of every kind of terrain the mountain has to offer, 
with plenty of steep ascents and descents as it repeatedly climbs out of a glacial valley, 
crests a ridge with stunning views in every direction, then plummets back down into the 
next valley.

The trail was first established in 1915, primarily for use by rangers on patrol for 
poachers and wildfires although The Mountaineers
<a href="https://www.mountaineers.org/about/history/the-mountaineer-annuals/indexes-annuals-maps/the-mountaineer-1915">hiked it</a>
that very first year. It wasn't until 1920 that the Park Service named it the Wonderland, 
realizing they had created one of the most magnificent recreational backcountry 
adventures in the world.

Most people take between 7 and 12 days to complete the circuit. The Park Service allows a 
maximum of 14 days for a reservation, while some exceptional fastpacking athletes do it 
in as little as 3 days. Or if you really want to have your mind blown, do a web search 
for 'rainier infinity loop'.


## How?|How To Get A Wonderland Permit

You can't just camp wherever you like on Mount Rainier. There are designated backcountry 
campsites, with pit toilets and bear poles for hanging your food, and you need a permit 
that lists exactly what dates and camps you will stay at.

The permit lottery is extremely competitive. Around 600 Wonderland circuits can be 
reserved in advance each season, while another ~300 are issued as walkup permits, but in 
recent years the Park has received over 10,000 lottery entries! Demand is increasing each 
year while trail capacity remains the same, so this is only likely to get worse in the 
future. Be prepared to keep trying over several years before your number comes up.

The Mount Rainier wilderness permit system is not specific to just the Wonderland Trail. 
Whether you want to hike a full Wonderland circuit, a section of the trail, something 
shorter like the Northern Loop, or an overnight out-and-back, you need the same kind of 
permit and have the same options and odds for getting one.

Permits are only required for overnight camping. You can day hike any trails you like on 
Rainier, or even run the whole Wonderland in sections from trailhead to trailhead, 
without any kind of permit as long as you get off the trail before sleeping.

The permit system is quite complicated, but in summary: 2/3 of capacity is available to 
be reserved in advance, with an annual lottery for early access to the booking system, 
while 1/3 is reserved for last minute walkups. Details can vary from year to year, so check 
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm">https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm</a>
for the latest information. What follows is accurate as of 2022.


<p class="heading">Early Access Lottery</p>

The early access lottery is run via
<a href="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/4675317">recreation.gov</a>. For a small fee, 
your name will be entered into a random drawing that gives you early access to the online 
booking system. It's important to understand that winning the lottery does NOT 
automatically give you a Wonderland permit! You are competing for the chance to attempt 
booking your trip before everyone else gets access, not directly for the trip itself.

2022 lottery applications can be entered from February 21 to March 7, with results 
available on March 14 (note dates may vary in future years). Exactly when within this 
period you enter makes no difference to your chances. The lottery allows one entry per 
person, and at this point there's no need to specify what route you are hoping to hike or 
dates you want to go etc.


<p class="heading">Early Access Reservations</p>

Congrats, so you won the lottery! You will be issued a date and time, which in 2022 
ranges from March 21 to April 19, when you along with a few others will gain 
access to the self-serve
<a href="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/4675317">recreation.gov</a> booking system. 
On this website you can see what campsites are available on which dates, enter whatever 
itinerary you like using these camps, and book your trip.

Of course the more trips that have already been booked, the fewer campsites will still be 
available. This means not all lottery wins are created equal. If you luck out and get one 
of the first access slots, the mountain is your oyster and you'll be able to book any 
itinerary you want. If you landed in the middle of the early access period, you'll most 
likely still be able to book a full Wonderland circuit but the most popular camps at the 
most popular dates will already be full. If your access slot falls toward the later end, be 
prepared for disappointment as only scraps will be left. With creativity you may still be 
able to figure out a fun trip, but it's unlikely you'll find enough open camps to make it 
all the way around the Wonderland.

Unless you're extremely experienced with snow travel, beware the temptation to book June 
trips if you see that July through September is full up. There's a reason those dates are 
still available...

The online booking system includes several "out of wilderness" options. Selecting one of 
these DOES NOT reserve anywhere for you to camp! It's a way of indicating that you have 
made your own separate arrangements for somewhere to stay that night. Perhaps you booked 
a night at the National Park Inn, or at a frontcountry car campsite, or a friend will 
drive you to a hotel outside the park, etc.

Early access winners don't have to log on and book their trip immediately when their time 
slot comes up, but the longer you wait, the more risk someone else will have taken the 
campsites you were hoping for. When I won early access in 2021 I was on the site hitting 
refresh the very second my access came due :-)

Early access winners are able to view campsite availability in advance of their own 
booking slot. This is a mixed bag. Being able to see this info is important for making a 
good plan, but it's quite stressful watching the availability decrease each time you 
check back on it!

To complete the booking you'll need the name of your backup trip leader (if any) and 
license plate of any vehicles you plan to leave in the park, so have that ready. It's ok 
to leave details blank if you'll be renting a car and don't yet know the license. The 
backup leader is important because if you find yourself unable to go for whatever reason, 
this other person will still be able to activate and use the permit. Permits cannot be 
transferred to other people who are not listed on them.

A lottery win allows you to book one trip. Whether you use this for a full Wonderland 
circuit or a single night in the wilderness is entirely up to you.


<p class="heading">General Access</p>

After all the early access winners have had their chance to book trips, the same 
self-serve <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/4675317">recreation.gov</a> site 
opens to everyone. In 2022 this occurs on April 25. After this date there is no limit on 
how many trips a person can book, and those who won early access can come back and try to 
book more trips if they want.

Let's be realistic: there will not be enough campsite availability left to put together a 
full Wonderland circuit at this time. We're talking scraps of the scraps. But sometimes 
scraps can be enough to make for great trips! In 2021 I was able to nab a night at Three 
Lakes camp in August this way, which formed the basis of a 3 day [EastsidePCTLoop].

If you're really dedicated it can be worth checking back as the season progresses, 
because people sometimes find themselves unable to go on a trip they had booked. If they 
cancel their reservation, those camps will become available for others to book.

Speaking of which: if you have a reservation that you're unable to use, please cancel it 
in advance, either online or by calling a ranger station!


<p class="heading">Permit Activation</p>

A reservation made online is not yet sufficient to hit the trail.
The person named on the reservation must show up at a
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm#CP_JUMP_664995">ranger 
station</a> to activate it, either the morning the trip begins or one day before.


<p class="heading">Walkups</p>

Only two thirds of campsite capacity is allocated through advance reservations, while one 
third is held in reserve for walkup permits. This pool may be further increased by 
advance reservation no-shows, as any reservations that are not activated by noon on the 
day the trip begins will be returned to the walkup pool.

Walkups are issued on an as-available basis to anyone who arrives in person at a
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm#CP_JUMP_664995">ranger 
station</a> for a trip starting that day or the next.

Historically, many have reported better success getting out on the trail via walkup 
permits compared to the advance lottery, but this requires a high level of dedication and 
a leap of faith to book time off work, pack supplies, then drive to the mountain without 
knowing for sure if a trip will be possible. As demand for the trail increases, walkups 
are starting to look more like a gamble than a sure thing.

You can improve walkup chances by being extremely flexible about route. One strategy is 
to arrive at the ranger station super early so you're first in line when they open. 
Another is to arrive at noon in hope that permit no-shows will have released a fresh 
batch of campsites. Starting midweek avoids competition with weekend warriors who are 
trying for shorter trips.

Walkup success is usually followed by a flurry of driving around the mountain to drop off 
supply caches in locations that couldn't be known until after your itinerary is settled. 
This can take all day, so plan your first trail day accordingly.

If you live locally, walkups can be a great option for shorter late season trips, when 
there's plenty of campsite availability and the main challenge is jumping on a suitable 
weather window. I enjoyed a fantastic [NorthPuyallup] overnight in October this way.


<p class="heading">Group Size</p>

Each backcountry camp contains a number of individual campsites, and most also have a 
larger group site. Your reservation will be for either an individual or group site, and 
you must camp in a matching location. Which of the individual sites you use within a 
camp is first-come-first-served, not specified on your permit.

The Park Service describes the individual sites as being for parties of 1 to 5 people in 
up to 3 tents, but in practice the limiting factor will be space for the tents. You must 
fit all tents and hammocks within the established bounds of the campsite. A couple of 
2-person tents will fit comfortably in every individual site, more in some, but 3 tents 
would be unpleasantly or even impossibly crowded in many.

The group sites are for use by groups of 6 to 12 people. Some of these are truly huge, 
while others would struggle to fit more than 4 or 5 2-person tents.


## When?|When To Hike The Wonderland Trail

The Wonderland Trail is most commonly hiked during the months of July, August, and 
September:

<ul>
  <li>
    July marks the transition from winter conditions to great hiking, but the melt date 
    varies greatly from year to year. Risks include deep snow at higher elevations, 
    consequently difficult route finding, and raging rivers where missing bridges may not 
    yet have been replaced. If you make reservations for early July, be prepared either 
    with the skills for safe snow travel, or to cancel at the last minute if the mountain 
    does not melt according to your schedule that year.
  </li>
  <li>
    August is the most popular month, and for good reason. Best weather. Best 
    wildflowers. Perhaps still some snow on the high passes, but most of the trail will 
    have melted. Most people. Most mosquitoes.
  </li>
  <li>
    September offers fall foliage colors, fewer bugs, and highest probability of the 
    whole trail being in good condition, but also cooler nights and some risk of early 
    fall snow. There may be (slightly) less competition for permits, as many cannot 
    backpack during the school term.
  </li>
</ul>

Some people do complete the trail in June or October (or even beyond!) but these months 
greatly increase the odds of encountering winter conditions or dangerous river crossings.


## Where?|Where To Go On A Wonderland Circuit

First question is where to start? There are multiple trailheads around the Wonderland:

<ul>
  <li>
    Longmire (southwest side of the mountain) is the most popular. It's easily accessible 
    year-round, has copious parking, toilets with running water, a restaurant, and a 
    small shop in case you forgot your toothbrush. There's also a historic lodge where 
    you could stay the night before or after your hike.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sunrise (northeast side) is in many ways similar to Longmire, with plentiful parking, 
    running water, cafe, and a small shop, but it has no lodge and is at higher elevation 
    so the access road may close during early or late season snowfalls. Note that the 
    Sunrise trailhead is 0.5 miles from the Wonderland Trail proper, and 1.3 miles from 
    Sunrise Camp.
  </li>
  <li>
    White River is near Sunrise but at lower elevation, so it remains accessible when the 
    road to Sunrise is closed. There is running water here, but no other amenities.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mowich Lake (northwest side) has only pit toilets, and lies at the end of a long, 
    dusty, potholed road. It may be closed due to snow early or late in the season.
  </li>
  <li>
    Box Canyon (southeast side) has plenty of parking space and toilets with running water.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fryingpan Creek and Reflection Lakes are theoretically valid options, but not 
    particularly desirable due to limited parking and lack of amenities.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Paul Peak and Carbon River trailheads are not on the Wonderland Trail at all, but 
    can be useful access points when Mowich Lake is closed due to snow. Or bailout points 
    if your trip goes poorly :-(
  </li>
</ul>

Whichever of Longmire or Sunrise you don't start at, the cafe there may offer a pleasant 
mid-trip lunch break. The National Park Inn at Longmire serves a range of meals, while 
Sunrise has cold snacks and a cooler of ice cream treats. Just be aware that stopping for 
food at Sunrise adds an extra mile.

Next up, which direction to hike? Personally I don't think this matters much, as 
either direction involves the exact same amount of up and down, plus the same views 
as long as you remember to turn around occasionally. Minor factors to consider are:

<ul>
  <li>
    Going clockwise makes it easier to carry water from St. Andrews Lake if you are 
    staying at Klapatche Park, which often dries up later in the season.
  </li>
  <li>
    The washed out section of trail along Stevens Canyon is easier to traverse 
    going clockwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some claim that going counterclockwise has steeper uphills vs. clockwise where the 
    descents are steeper, but I'm not convinced. Seems to me there is plenty of both in 
    either direction!
  </li>
</ul>

Yet another choice: at the northwest corner of the mountain, follow the official 
Wonderland Trail over Ipsut Pass, or take the popular alternative route over Spray Park?

<ul>
  <li>
    The Ipsut Pass route is more sheltered in bad weather, and features stunning 
    old growth temperate rainforest plus the devastation of the glacial Carbon River 
    valley. It requires crossing that river on a log bridge that has an unfortunate habit 
    of getting washed away.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Spray Park route is slightly shorter but with more elevation change, and features 
    some of the best alpine wildflower meadows on the mountain. The highest part remains 
    snow covered for much of the year, and can be tricky to navigate in bad weather.
  </li>
</ul>

Both options are great, so clearly the best solution is to pick one at random for your 
Wonderland circuit, then come back later and hike the [SprayParkLoop] to also see the 
other.

If you are visiting from out of state, you'll need to rent a car. There is no public 
transport to the National Park, private shuttle options are limited and expensive, and 
taxis or Uber not a good fit for an area that mostly lacks cell service.


## Campsites

There are many choices while planning a Wonderland circuit. This website includes a 
<a href="../Planner.html">Wonderland Itinerary Planner</a> which shows distance and 
elevation change between your choice of trailheads and campsites.

Going clockwise from Longmire, campsites along the Wonderland trail are:

Longmire itself has nowhere to camp, but you could book a room in its lodge, or camp at 
Cougar Rock (a frontcountry car campground) 1.5 miles up the road.

Oftentimes, the secret of success for getting a Wonderland permit is flexibility. The 
more you're able to adjust dates, direction, duration, and campsites, the better your 
odds of something being available. Sometimes this can involve putting together creative 
routes that stray off the Wonderland in places, making use of whatever campsites are 
still available. There are many such possibilities, including:

<table class="campstable">
  <tr>
    <th/>
    <th>Individual Sites</th>
    <th>Group Site</th>
    <th>Elevation</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>

    <td>yes</td>

      only adds 3.3 miles total distance if you substitute this in place of going past 
      Sunrise (and it's a much nicer place than White River to camp...)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Olallie Creek</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>3900'</td>
    <td>1.2 miles off the Wonderland, between Indian Bar and Nickel Creek</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Snow Lake</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>no</td>
    <td>4700'</td>
    <td>
      1.5 miles off the Wonderland (including 0.4 miles of road), between Maple Creek and 
      Reflection Lakes
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Another source of flexibility can be found in substituting other trails for unavailable 
sections of the Wonderland. If none of Dick Creek, Mystic Camp, or Granite Creek are 
available, you could detour via the [NorthernLoop] and stay at James Camp or Fire Creek 
instead. If Summerland and Indian Bar are fully booked, hop over to the Eastside Trail 
and go via Tamanos Creek, Deer Creek, and Olallie Creek. The latter can be particularly 
useful because Summerland and Indian Bar tend to fill up early, so they often end up 
being the limiting factor in putting together a full circuit.


## Caching Supplies|Caching Supplies Around The Wonderland

If you don't fancy the idea of carrying all the supplies for your entire trip, you can 
cache food and fuel at Longmire, Mowich Lake, Sunrise, and White River. Caches must be 
stored in rodent-proof containers: typically a 5 gallon plastic bucket. Food 
caches can be mailed or delivered by hand, while fuel caches must be hand-delivered. See
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/caching-food-and-fuel.htm">https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/caching-food-and-fuel.htm</a>
for details, and note that caches for pickup at Mowich Lake should be delivered to the 
Carbon River Ranger Station instead.

Sunrise and White River are close enough together that it doesn't make sense to cache at 
both. Use White River if you are going clockwise, or Sunrise if counterclockwise, to 
avoid having to lug a freshly refilled pack up or down the steep trail between the two.

Each cache location also has bearproof trashcans for disposing of your rubbish.

If you are camping at a cache location (Mowich, White River) or near one (Sunrise), 
consider including heavy treats that can be eaten on the spot. Tinned food, soda and beer 
ftw!

There are occasional stories of food being stolen from caches at Mowich Lake. This is 
very rare, but has happened more than zero times. Cache locations also have a donation 
bin where people can leave unwanted supplies, so I hope the backpackers who had their 
food taken were able to find enough replacements to keep going! And to whoever was so low 
as to steal from others in the wilderness: I pray to Our Lady The Mountain that you may 
be eaten by a bear forthwith :-)

Speaking of which: bears are common on Rainier, so it's important to properly hang all 
your food and other scented supplies such as toiletries. Thanks to bear poles at every 
camp, bear canisters are not needed during the main hiking season, but the poles are 
taken down during the off-season.


## Hazards

By far the greatest danger along the Wonderland Trail is the many glacial river 
crossings. Some rivers have sturdy wooden bridges over them while others are spanned by 
cool suspension bridges, but many have just a log plus a railing if you are lucky. 
Falling off these logs into fast moving turbid waters, which are often filled with 
rolling boulders, is not good for your life expectancy. Also, these rivers have a habit 
of repeatedly removing their log crossings, so the Park Service is playing a perpetual 
game of whack-a-mole trying to keep the bridges in place.

River conditions can vary day to day and even hour to hour as melt levels change 
(mornings are better for crossing). It's a good idea to research bridge status before you 
set out, but be aware that a log which existed when you started your hike may have washed 
away by the time you arrive at its river, or a missing bridge may have been replaced. 
Judge for yourself, and turn back if you don't like what you see.

With the caveat that even minor streams may be problematic at times of high flow, notable 
crossings to be aware of include:

<ul>
  <li>
    Pyramid Creek (between Pyramid Creek Camp and Devil's Dream) is a substantial river 
    crossed by log bridge with railing.
  </li>
  <li>
    South Mowich River (by South Mowich Camp, between Golden Lakes and Mowich Lake) has 
    multiple forks that frequently change their course. Sometimes there are log bridges 
    over them, or there may be fallen trees you can cross on. This is probably the most 
    dangerous and unpredictable of the rivers, combining remote location with lack of 
    alternatives if you can't find a good way across it.
  </li>
  <li>
    The lower Carbon River crossing (between Ipsut Creek and Carbon River Camp) happens 
    to be washed out at the time I'm writing this. This would be a risky river to attempt 
    fording if there is no bridge in place when you arrive there. An alternative is to 
    take the Spray Park route instead of going via Ipsut Pass and Ipsut Creek, which 
    avoids this log bridge location and allows you to cross the Carbon River on a nice 
    suspension bridge instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    Winthrop Creek (between Mystic Lake and Granite Creek) was the site of a fatality in 
    2018, at which time its log bridge had no railing. A railing had been added by the 
    time I crossed here in 2020, but water was lapping over the top of the log at peak 
    melt times.
  </li>
  <li>
    White River (leaving White River campground heading toward Fryingpan Creek) is also 
    washed out at the time of this writing. If you can't cross safely here, detour down 
    the road and hop back onto the Wonderland shortly after crossing the road bridge.
  </li>
</ul>

In addition to the rivers, snow can of course be a hazard especially early in the season. 
The highest points along the Wonderland are Panhandle Gap (between Summerland and Indian 
Bar), Skyscraper Pass, and Spray Park (if you choose to go that way). These often remain 
snowy until the end of August, and there's a steep traverse approaching Panhandle Gap 
from the north that would be un-fun to slide down. Spikes aren't needed once most of the 
trail has melted, but it may be easier to cross these high places if you can arrange to 
do so later in the day when the snow is soft rather than icy. And make sure your 
navigation is solid for these sections! Most of the Wonderland Trail is obvious to 
follow, but Panhandle Gap and the top of Spray Park are just rocks and snow patches with 
cairns to mark the way, so it'd be easy to lose your way during bad weather.

One final hazard lies along Stevens Canyon, between Maple Creek and Reflection Lakes, 
where the trail crosses a washout with loose, unstable footing. I am told this is 
particularly unpleasant in wet conditions.

# My Wonderland

<i>pilgrimage (noun)</i>

<i>1. a journey, especially a long one, made to some sacred place as an act of religious devotion</i>

<i>2. any long journey, especially one undertaken as a quest or for a votive purpose, as to pay homage</i>

The Wonderland Trail means a lot to me. It is the reason I learned to backpack, and the 
reason this website exists. I got lucky in the 2021 permit lottery, and completed a 
leisurely 11 day circuit in early September, going clockwise from Longmire via Spray Park.


## Day 1: Longmire to Devil's Dream

[1-HelloGorgeous.jpg] Our first proper view of Tahoma comes while crossing Kautz Creek
[1-PyramidCreek.jpg] Bridge over Pyramid Creek
[1-SquawLake.jpg] Squaw Lake is shrunken and muddy, not a great water source at this time of year

<p class="subheading">8.4 miles, 3200' gain, 1200' descent</p>

Five of us set out from Longmire: me (Shawn), Meg, Sasha, Tanner, and Tanner. I had 
planned the trip for a group of seven, but one dropped out in advance and Mike ended up 
only able to join for a section due to work commitments.

I arrived at the ranger station around 9 AM to activate my permit, and met up with the 
others before 10. We were in no great hurry to get going as this was a short first day, 
so we stopped for a pricy but delicious latte at the National Park Inn. The Longmire gift 
shop offers a final opportunity to pick up any last minute supplies. Meg bought a map of 
the trail, which was arguably unnecessary given how easy the Wonderland is to follow and 
that she was hiking in a large group, but would later prove to be a wise decision.

Onto the trail, and straight into the first of so many Big Ups to come. We climbed 
through lush green forest, descended slightly to cross the flood damaged valleys of Kautz 
Creek and Pyramid Creek, then climbed more through varying forest to Devil's Dream camp, 
which is tucked unobtrusively into the woods by the side of the trail. Pyramid Creek 
really brought home how dynamic this landscape is, because several of us had visited here 
last year and remember the river channel being in a different place with a memorable 
double bridge across it. That bridge is now buried a foot deep under rocks, while a new 
bridge crosses the river in its revised location.

Aside: along this trip I heard many hikers disparaging forested trail sections such as 
this, viewing them as merely a tax that must be paid in order to reach the dramatic 
alpine regions. I feel sorry for these people! Learn to focus your gaze on the small and 
nearby as well as the grand and distant, open your ears to the trees which all have 
stories to tell, and you will find so much more delight just waiting to be had.

The Devil's Dream water source had dried up due to the late season, but we were 
forewarned of this so continued past camp up to the meadows and patrol cabin at Indian 
Henry's Hunting Grounds. Here we found water, enjoyed dinner, and watched the mountain 
change color as evening arrived. Without this extension, the day would have been just 5.8 
miles with 2800' elevation gain.

This section of the Wonderland can also be day hiked as [IndianHenrysFromLongmire].

<p class="subheading">8 miles, 2300' gain, 3000' descent</p>

On our second day, the "Wonder" part of the Wonderland really kicked in. We retraced our 
steps up to Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds, and explored the side spur to the attractive 
Mirror Lakes. Then comes a Big Down, switchbacking through forest into the valley of 
Tahoma Creek, which is crossed on a dramatic and wobbly suspension bridge.

Upward again, through a fascinatingly bizarre and desolate landscape of volcanic rock 
forms modified by glacial erosion. We ascended a lateral moraine, and although I was 
delighted with the composition of our hiking group, it was unfortunate that none of us 
were geologists. Note to self: find and befriend more geologists, so they can explain 
exactly what I'm looking at on future trips.

The climb tops out at Emerald Ridge, which is a high and almost shockingly green meadow 
with amazing views over the Tahoma Glacier and down the valley of the South Puyallup 
River. An incredible spot for lunch, and also the start of our second Big Down of the 
day. The trail consists of loose rock as it descends a sometimes narrow and 
precarious/exposed ridge toward the South Puyallup River: careful footing is essential 
here.

What a day. What a trail. What a mountain.

<p class="subheading">11.8 miles, 4100' gain, 3300' descent</p>

This was our hardest day, in both total mileage and elevation gain. It consists of a Big 
Up, Big Down, then another Big Up.

The trail switchbacks upward through forest, then straightens out as it ascends a 
ridgeline and views open up, including behind us to the Gobbler's Knob fire lookout. Into 
the subalpine of St. Andrews Park, a lunch stop at the stupendously beautiful St. Andrews 
Lake, then a relatively level traverse across to Klapatche Park and its predictably 
dried-up-by-September water source, Aurora Lake.

Now down, down, down a series of steep switchbacks to the North Puyallup River, with 
periodic views of dramatic rock spires above us. But what is this: stonework so deep in 
the wilderness? North Puyallup Camp is where construction ended when the attempt to 
connect the Westside Road through to Mowich Lake was abandoned, so these stone bulwarks 
have been growing moss for nearly a century now.

The second climb of the day is a sneaky one. It starts gently through rich forest, so I 
was moving fast and feeling good. But it gets steeper. And steeper. I was no longer 
feeling so strong... Fortunately there were many delicious huckleberries (technically 
blueberries, but huckleberry is the local name for mountain blueberries) along this 
section of trail, so I stopped to snack often.

Eventually the forest opens into the unusual landscape of Sunset Park. Fall foliage 
colors make a stark contrast with the bright white skeletons of dead trees, bleached by 
the weather after an old fire, as Her Highness Tahoma The Great overlooks it all.

Near bear encounter #1: shortly after Meg and I passed through this area, Sasha and 
Tanner met a bear along the trail, and Mike saw one in the same place later that evening. 
We must have walked right by it.

Golden Lakes is a beautiful campsite. The lake is pretty although muddy and far from my 
favorite water source, but the sunset viewpoint above camp more than makes up for that. 
Mike joined us here, having hiked in from Mowich Lake.

For dinner I tried my first ramen bomb, a recipe that Sasha and Tanner told me about. 
Take spicy instant ramen, cook them with more water than usual, then stir in a packet of 
instant mashed potatoes. And lo, it was good. It is essential that this meal ONLY EVER be 
eaten after a long day on the trail, however :-)

This got me thinking. A problem with freeze dried dinners is that if you include enough 
water to avoid crunchy non-rehydrated bits, everything inevitably ends up too soupy. 
Could that be fixed by turning all meals into mini-bombs? Wait until they are fully 
rehydrated and then add just enough instant potato powder to soak up excess moisture. 
This warrants further investigation.


## Day 4: Golden Lakes to Mowich Lake

<p class="subheading">10.2 miles, 2600' gain, 2700' descent</p>

This was a straightforward day consisting of a Big Down to cross the South and North 
Mowich Rivers, followed by a Big Up to Mowich Lake, all through forest without views. But 
what a forest: this is a valley of wild and remote temperate rainforest where it would 
feel unsurprising to run across a dinosaur, or at very least a sasquatch.

South Mowich River is a notoriously difficult crossing with a bad habit of shedding any 
bridges that are put across it. The bridge was in when we crossed, but a ranger later 
told us it washed out again the very next day. It was fascinating to see the wide river 
plain littered with remnants of bridges prior.

Near the river is an old wooden shelter with amusing graffiti carved into its beams: 
"Will it ever stop raining?" and "Drip, Drip".

Mowich Lake is a most unusual campsite because it is not wilderness at all: tents are 
pitched tightly together in an old gravel parking lot. There is no privacy here, but 
there are picnic benches, and, glory of glory, it's our first cache resupply location! We 
can throw away trash, refill our food bags, and enjoy some heavier treats. I reverted to 
my college days by eating Heinz baked beans, cold, straight from the tin. So delicious. 
At the ranger cabin is a hiker box where unwanted supplies can be donated for anyone else 
to pick up, and Sasha was delighted to find couscous there. We went for a swim. Life is 
good.


## Day 5: Mowich Lake to Cataract Valley

[5-Silhouette.jpg] Trees silhouetted against the cloud
[5-MistyTrees.jpg] A damp, misty morning

[5-Toilet.jpg] Nice location for a toilet: pikas can watch me poop

<p class="subheading">6.9 miles, 2100' gain, 2600' descent</p>

Meg and Tanner got up early for a dawn hike to [TolmiePeak] while the rest of us enjoyed 
a relaxed morning. Turns out the early risers were the only ones to enjoy views today, 
because the clouds rolled in and made our trip over Spray Park an experience of moody 
misty dampness. This is one of the higher parts of the trail where plants give way to 
barren rocks, cairns mark the way, and even this late in the season there were a couple 
of small snowfields to cross.

Near bear encounter #2: berry pickers coming the other way told us there was a bear in 
the meadow a few hundred yards ahead, but we saw it not.

Unfortunately, Tanner One developed a knee injury which slowed him down and made 
continuing on this strenuous trail inadvisable. After sleeping on it, he and Meg made the 
wise decision to bail, so they headed out the next day down the gentle gradient to the 
Carbon River entrance, where they got a ride from a nice lady in a sporty red convertible.

Congrats Meg and Tanner on completing the western section of the Wonderland, from 
Longmire to Carbon River via Spray Park!

This section of the Wonderland can also be day hiked as [SprayPark].

<p class="subheading">7.2 miles, 3200' gain, 2000' descent</p>

We awoke to blue skies and glorious sunshine, perfect for this incredible section of 
trail. Downhill at first, over the Carbon River on our second suspension bridge, and then 
a Big Up climbing steeply alongside and with glorious views over the Carbon Glacier. 
Views continued as we entered Moraine Park, where Mike peeled off to climb up Curtis 
Ridge, and then we arrived at Mystic Lake which is one of my most favoritest specialest places ever.

The campsite is a short distance past the lake, so we set up our tents, hung damp 
clothing (from yesterday) to dry, then headed back up to the lake for a swim, dinner, and 
to watch the sunset. Don't miss the side trail to the patrol cabin, which is situated up a 
hillside behind the lake.

We found another group of hikers squatting without permit in our group campsite after 
finding themselves unable to keep up with their scheduled itinerary. This felt 
uncomfortable at first (hey, we have a permit for this site!) but they were unobtrusive 
and everyone fit ok. It's a tough trail, this one. The next day we encountered multiple 
other people in the same situation.

Near bear encounter #3: just a few minutes after our visit to the patrol cabin, down 
that same trail came a park employee who'd met a bear that immediately climbed a tree 
upon seeing him. Mike was delayed in reaching camp after his scramble because a bear was 
blocking the trail just before the lake, so he waited a half hour for it to move. I'm 
pretty sure I heard a bear snuffling through camp and around the pole during the night, 
and the other group who were sharing our site thought the same thing.


## Day 7: Mystic Camp to Sunrise Camp

<p class="subheading">10.7 miles, 3200' gain, 2500' descent</p>

Mike left us this morning, hiking back to Mowich Lake as his time off work had come to an 
end. And thus we were three.

After Mystic Lake comes a really ingenious bit of trail design where the path descends a 
series of lateral moraines approaching the Winthrop Glacier. Very fun and cleverly put 
together. The glacier was impressive, and Winthrop Creek crossing straightforward. Next 
comes a Big Up, at first steeply with views of the glacier, then more gently through 
gorgeous forest past Granite Creek, where we met some other hikers who have the same last 
few days itinerary as us. Continuing upward out of the trees to Skyscraper Pass, it was 
too cloudy for any views today so I decided to cancel my idea for a side trip up 
Skyscraper Mountain (I'll be back for that some other day).

Into Berkely Park, and all of a sudden the trail got busy. So many marmots! And 
golden-mantled ground squirrels. Also, day hikers. Clean smelling people with tiny packs.

Problem: Tanner Two was not feeling well. We continued the extra mile past Sunrise Camp 
to the main Sunrise complex, where the Park Service did some kind of magic (have I 
mentioned yet how great the Park Service is?) and summoned an EMT seemingly out of thin 
air to check him over. Sasha and Tanner made the difficult but wise decision not to 
continue further into the wilderness while feeling short of 100%, so they dropped off the 
trail here and I found myself unexpectedly on my own.

I hike solo all the time and am comfortable alone in the mountains, but it took me a good 
half day to shift gears to this new situation. I was greatly enjoying the company of our 
most excellent hiking group, and I missed them. From here on, puns would remain unsaid 
due to lack of Tanners.

Congrats Sasha and Tanner on completing the western and northern sections of the 
Wonderland, from Longmire to Sunrise!

Near bear encounter #4: on my way from Sunrise back to camp, other hikers told me a mama 
bear and cub had been seen inside the camp area. When I arrived there, a cluster of 
backpackers were looking up at a hillside where the bear, far enough away to appear just 
a black speck, was blocking the trail up to 1st Burroughs. Eventually she moved and 
normal trail traffic resumed.

It got cold here at night, so I wore hiking pants, down jacket, hat and gloves inside my 
sleeping bag.


## Day 8: Sunrise Camp to Summerland

<p class="subheading">10.5 miles, 2400' gain, 2800' descent</p>

Today started with a Big Down, switchbacking through forest with intermittent views of 
Little Tahoma, the summit, and over clouds that were flowing up the White River valley.

Our second resupply cache at White River broke my heart. There were three buckets waiting 
for me, but only one hiker left to claim them! I threw out my trash, refilled my food 
bag, and enjoyed a ginger ale treat, but absent Sasha's delight at finding goodies in the 
hiker box there was no joy for me here. It did make me feel better when I later learned 
that the park will donate unclaimed supplies to a local food bank.

Balanced against the sadness was a growing feeling of I'm ok, I got this. White River was 
the first Rainier trailhead I ever visited, on my virginal hike to [GlacierBasin] so many 
years ago. It was wild to think that this time I'd walked here on foot all the way from 
Longmire.

Back on the trail, here's an oddity: a couple of miles of almost level forested trail. A 
flat path, along the Wonderland? Truly, wonders will never cease.

Hah, I knew this trail could not keep that up for long :-) Gradually the flat turns into 
a Big Up, following alongside Fryingpan Creek through forest, then crossing the creek on 
a log bridge and switchbacking up to the stupendously stunning meadows of Summerland. I 
lack words to properly describe this amazing place, so just look at the photos. It's 
ridiculous how pretty everything is.

Near bear encounter #5: the trail telegram told me there was a bear in the bushes just 
before the start of the switchbacks, and indeed there was. I saw branches moving a few 
dozen feet from the trail, but not the bear itself.

The Summerland group shelter is an old three-sided stone building. I wanted to try 
sleeping in it but had heard it is home to many rodents, so I set up my tent as a 
fallback, then got in my sleeping bag inside the stone shelter. The sun went down, I 
finished reading, clicked my headlamp off, and immediately: &lt;scurry&gt; &lt;scurry&gt; 
&lt;squeak&gt; &lt;pitter pitter&gt;. "Hey, this is my bedroom!" "Well, we live here 
24/7". "Ok then, I guess it cannot be my bedroom". I decamped ignominiously to my tent, 
where I enjoyed good sleep.

This section of the Wonderland can also be day hiked as [PanhandleGap].

<p class="subheading">4.7 miles, 1200' gain, 2100' descent</p>

What a day this was. Up there with the very best days of my life.

I got up early and spent an hour watching dawn color the face of the mountain while three 
deer grazed in the meadow below me. Back to camp for breakfast, only for a fox to wander 
through while I was filtering water. Could it get any more magical?

Turns out yes, it could. This section of trail, up to Panhandle Gap, traversing across 
the high alpine, then a Big Down to Indian Bar, is the ultimate expression of the rock, 
ice, and strangeness of my favorite mountain. Cliffs and waterfalls abound, with big and 
constantly changing views in every direction, all overseen by a massive cloud halo that 
sat over the summit of Tahoma. I was moving slowly with not that much distance to cover, 
taking it all in, taking SO many photos, literally laughing out loud on multiple 
occasions, overcome by the sheer incredibleness of it all.

The final descent to Indian Bar is a knee-busting feat of trail engineering, with 
countless wooden steps to control erosion along this steep path. Eternal gratitude to the 
trail crews who make such things possible.

The group shelter at Indian Bar, like that at Summerland, is an old stone building. Fool 
me once... This time I set up my tent <i>inside</i> the shelter, and enjoyed a restful 
mouse-free sleep. I invited another group of hikers to share the site with me, as it was 
too special and had too much room to keep for myself.

Let's talk toilets for a moment. There is a great variety of them around the Wonderland, 
ranging from basic holes in the ground to fancy composting devices. Some are enclosed in 
wooden shacks while others sit proudly out in the open. The group site toilet at Indian 
Bar boasts the greatest view of any toilet I've shat on to date, and is also where I met 
someone with a truly unique job: hike into the wilderness, spend a few hours in a hazmat 
suit emptying sewage from a hole in the ground into plastic buckets, prepare those for 
later helicopter pickup, then hike back out. Respect!

<p class="subheading">10.4 miles, 2000' gain, 4300' descent</p>

According to the stats this should be one of the toughest days of my trip, with by far 
the most descent, but my legs must be getting stronger because I just started walking, 
trudged along for a bit, then arrived at camp, without any particular soreness or getting 
tired. I'm in the groove and feel like I could keep doing this indefinitely.

Descending the Cowlitz Divide was a moody experience, socked into a cloud and lacking its 
usual views.  The Box Canyon trailhead offers running water and toilets that flush (such 
luxury) followed by a few miles of the most delightfully green forest on the way to Maple 
Creek camp. The only downside to this camp is occasional traffic noise from the road that 
runs up the other side of Stevens Canyon.

This section of the Wonderland can also be day hiked as [IndianBar].

[11-ReflectionLakes.jpg] Over the last 11 days I have gotten to know Tahoma from all angles. I have seen her disheveled in the evenings with wisps of cloud across her glaciers, slumped with tiredness in her western aspect, and early in the mornings with a rosy glow to her slopes. But here she is distancing herself, preparing to say goodbye, retreating to the formality of this picture postcard view from Reflection Lakes

<p class="subheading">10.9 miles, 2600' gain, 2600' descent</p>

During this last day my head is filled with reminiscence and reflections. I am ready to 
go home, yet not ready for this experience to be over. Today's trail is a mostly 
uneventful Big Up followed by Big Down, but at this point I am literally taking such 
things in my stride. Its most notable feature is a washed out section along the side of 
Stevens Canyon, where the trail crosses an old landslide with loose, unstable footing. I 
had read and worried much about this, but in the end it was no problem at all (luckily it 
was dry that day).

At Reflection Lakes I experienced for the first time a phenomenon I had read about. I 
could no longer smell myself or other backpackers, but when I encountered day hikers I 
found the clouds of chemically fake flower scent that surrounded them nearly 
overwhelming. Yikes! If they smell like that to me, I can only imagine what I must smell 
like to them :-)

And that's it. Back to my car, a few hours on the road, then to hug Tracy and pet the 
dogs and take a bath and eat pizza.


## Reflections

[Feet.jpg] Lookin' good!

I set out with perhaps unrealistically high expectations for this hike, yet was not 
disappointed. My preparation proved up to the task: mentally and physically, my 
knowledge, fitness, gear and food choices were dialed in. Assorted chafes, hotspots and 
ankle aches threatened at various points, but responded well to a stern talking-to. I 
encountered no bugs and got no blisters.

As the days passed, my focus narrowed. No thoughts of work or the news, just one foot 
after another, one camp to the next, view to view, living fully in the present and paying 
complete attention to my immediate surroundings. Forward planning was limited to 
wondering what the weather would do next (speculation without influence) and deciding 
what to have for dinner (from a very limited set of options). The trip almost became an 
extended period of meditation.

I developed a surprising affection for the equipment I was carrying. Each item was 
carefully chosen to fulfill a necessary purpose, and nothing was redundant. Oh red 
fleece, how I love the way you keep me warm on windy parts of the trail, and also wrap my 
other clothes to create a pillow at night. Beloved camp shoes, you're so great at 
protecting my feet while letting them air out after a long day on the trail. There was 
magic in the routine of establishing a comfortable home each evening, then folding it all 
back up to continue on my way the next day.

My only regret is that the rest of my group was unable to complete the whole circuit with 
me. They were great company, my kind of hikers, and I have so much respect for the wisdom 
they showed in dropping off the trail before small problems had a chance to grow into 
major ones. We found our satellite communicator devices invaluable for keeping folk back 
home informed while this was going on, and for letting those still on the trail know when 
others had made it safely home. We carried 3 Garmin inReaches between our group of 6, and 
learned some things about how best to use them:
<ul>
    <li>
        When splitting into 2 groups over Spray Park, we really should have made sure 
        each party had an inReach, rather than all 3 being with the same people!
    </li>
    <li>
        We should have pre-tested sending messages directly from one inReach to another. 
        Come to find out this didn't work the way we thought, so we were only able to 
        communicate indirectly via at-home contacts.
    </li>
</ul>

Sasha made a video covering the first 2/3 of the circuit:

Thank you Tahoma for blessing my pilgrimage with great weather and excellent trail 
conditions. All praise the trail crews for bridges in and blowdowns cleared. These sights 
and memories will stay with me forever. Truly, the Wonderland Trail is well named.


## Gear List

[Food.jpg] Preparing my food. Still to add: tortilla wraps, cheese sticks, and hunk of parmesan. The tinned goods are Mowich resupply treats, to be eaten directly at the cache location rather than carried in my pack
