Salamander

This may look like the character Toothless from the movie <i>How To Train Your 
Dragon</i>, but it's actually a salamander in its paedomorphic stage. I think probably a 
Northwestern Salamander, but am not entirely sure.

At least 9 species of salamander inhabit Mount Rainier National Park. Common to most of 
them, like other amphibians, is that adults lay eggs in water, which hatch into tadpoles 
with gills, which increase in size before metamorphosing into adults with lungs that live 
on land.

Unique to salamanders is the possibility of pedomorphosis, also known as neoteny, in 
which an individual retains juvenile features such as gills while becoming reproductively 
mature, without undergoing metamorphosis into the normal adult form. Most famously, the 
axolotl of Mexico reproduce entirely this way. Other salamander species selectively 
enable neoteny in response to harsh conditions where the adults could not survive on land, 
such as higher altitude.

Salamanders can regenerate lost limbs, tails, and even complex tissues such as the 
retina of the eye, within just a few weeks of an injury.

Salamander populations are decreasing due to deforestation, the introduction of
<a href="Trout.html">predators</a>, and pollution. Their larva are uniquely sensitive to 
contaminants such as soap, deodorant, sun lotion, and most of all picaridin bug spray, so 
it is important not to bathe in mountain lakes or streams after using any of these 
products. Before getting in, scoop some lake water into a bottle, walk 200 feet away from 
the lake so your contaminants don't just flow down into it, and give yourself a good 
scrub with cloth + water.
