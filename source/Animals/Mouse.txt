Deer Mouse

To many Rainier hunters (foxes, coyotes, bobcats, owls, martens, mink) the deer mouse 
looks like dinner. These North American mice are only distantly related to the common 
house mouse, having larger eyes, white bellies, and much greater jumping ability (hence 
their name).

Wonderland backpackers are likely to encounter them if staying in the stone shelters at 
Summerland and Indian Bar, which were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 
Great Depression and have been inhabited by mice ever since. They are notorious for 
making a mess of improperly hung supplies, to the extent where the bear poles found at 
Rainier campsites really ought to be called mouse poles! They also sometimes break into 
cars parked at trailheads, especially if any snacks were left in the car.

Deer mice will nest anywhere from underground burrows to 80' up a tree.

In the western United States, they are the natural reservoir for hantavirus, a rare but 
potentially fatal disease spread through their feces and urine. Beware if you find mouse 
droppings in your tent, shelter, or food bag.

In his book <i>"A Year in Paradise"</i>, Floyd Schmoe describes a deer mouse called Oscar 
who lived year-round in the hut at Camp Muir. It is unclear how a mouse could have got 
there, let alone survived, but there is evidence from elsewhere of deer mice adapting to 
the harsh conditions of surprisingly high elevations.
