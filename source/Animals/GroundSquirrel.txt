Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel

[../EastsideLoop/1-GroundSquirrel.jpg]

These charming little rascals are often mistaken for
<a href="YellowPineChipmunk.html">chipmunks</a>, but this is actually a golden-mantled 
ground squirrel. An easy way to tell the difference is that chipmunks have stripes on 
their faces as well as sides.

They are omnivorous consumers of plants, insects, eggs, carrion, and hiker food. 
Especially if previous hikers have fed one (please don't do that!) they can become so 
bold that they'll try to climb into your pack looking for food the moment you set it down.

They're usually solitary, and hibernate alone in long (up to 100 feet) but shallow dens.
