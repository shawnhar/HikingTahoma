Mountain Goat

These splendidly shaggy magnificent mountain climbers are incredibly well adapted to the 
high and steep places of the world. Sufficiently insulated to survive winter temperatures 
as low as -50&deg;, their feet combine snowshoes (cloven hooves that can spread apart) 
with crampons (sharp dewclaws). Young goats start rock scrambling within a day of being 
born.

My brother says they should be called snow gruffaloes.

On Rainier you may encounter them around Burroughs Mountain, Skyscraper Pass, Panhandle 
Gap, Van Trump Park, or off-trail alpine areas such as Cowlitz Gap.

They can be aggressive with each other, as nannies fight for dominance over territory and 
billies during mating season, plus sometimes with humans.

Although related to true goats, they're closer to the chamois and not a member of the 
genus Capra.

Mountain goats have never been domesticated, but indigenous people of the Pacific 
Northwest collected their spring molt (left after rubbing on rocks and trees) to include 
in weavings.
