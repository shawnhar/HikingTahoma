Trout

Rainier's many lakes originally contained no fish, but had thriving populations of 
amphibians including salamanders. The rivers were inhabited by migratory trout and 
salmon, which have been greatly affected by the construction of dams further downstream 
that now block every major drainage.

Between 1915 and 1972 the Park Service repeatedly stocked at least 25 different Rainier 
lakes with trout, to improve angling opportunities. As many as 9 million fry were 
released, at first using pack horses, then aircraft where a five-gallon plastic bag full 
of fish would be poured out while flying over a lake. Using just two years as an example, 
Mystic, Chenuis, Green, Green Park, Bench, Marsh, Snow, and Three Lakes were stocked in 
1960, then Adelaide, Eleanor, George, Hidden, James, Marjorie, Oliver, and Palisades 
Lakes in 1961. The new fish included non-native species (brook trout, sockeye salmon) 
plus native species such as cutthroat and rainbow/steelhead trout that were introduced to 
areas they did not historically occupy.

It is strange how blind the park was to preserving aquatic habitat for so many years. 
Long after the management policy for mammals, birds, and trees shifted from <i>"make it 
the most fun for visitors"</i> to <i>"preserve in natural state"</i>, nobody batted an 
eye at releasing all these fish. The first proper biological study of a Rainier lake 
didn't occur until 1966, at Mowich Lake, and only in 1993 did a study identify presence 
of the rare native bull trout, which is now a threatened species.

Non-native fish compete with native fish and amphibians, and may prey on native species. 
Current fishing regulations require catch-and-release for native species, but encourage 
eating or euthanization of any non-native fish that may be caught.
