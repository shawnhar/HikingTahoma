American Robin

Robins are one of the most adaptable birds of North America. During summer they are found 
across the USA and Canada, while in winter they migrate south to Mexico, the Gulf, or the 
Pacific coast.

The American robin was named after the European robin because of its red breast, although 
the two species are not closely related. Females often have paler breasts than males.

Robins are common in the forests of Rainier, where they are often seen foraging for 
insects on the ground.
