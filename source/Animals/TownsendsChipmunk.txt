Townsend's Chipmunk

The Townsend's chipmunk is found in dense wooded areas of the Pacific Northwest. They are 
solitary and territorial, living in individual burrows up to 30 feet long. They eat a 
wide range of fungi, berries, and seeds, and will forage as far as half a mile from their 
burrows, carrying back food in their cheek pouches.
