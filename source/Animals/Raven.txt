Raven

These large (up to 3 lb) and long lived (up to 20 years) corvids are common throughout 
the park, often seen soaring way up into the high alpine. They are omnivorous and 
extremely intelligent, with a swaggering walk that perhaps indicates awareness of their 
mythological role as both trickster god and Creator of the world.
