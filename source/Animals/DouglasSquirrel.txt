Douglas Squirrel

A common resident of old growth coniferous forests in the Pacific Northwest, 
Douglas squirrels are active during the day and often heard chattering alarm 
about passing hikers. They spend summer nights sleeping in nests made among 
the tree branches, but during winter will instead nest in holes that provide 
more warmth.

They are territorial and usually solitary, although mated pairs will jointly 
defend a shared territory during the mating season. Groups of squirrels seen 
together are usually youngsters from the same litter.

They mostly eat the seeds of coniferous trees such as Douglas fir, but will 
eat a wide range of other foods (acorns, berries, mushrooms, eggs, and some 
fruit) as needs must. Each squirrel hoards food in a single location, 
building up a giant pile of discarded pine scales (up to several meters 
across!) after years of methodically stripping down one pine cone after 
another to get to the seeds inside.
