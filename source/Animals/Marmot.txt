Hoary marmots are also known as whistle pigs, due to the calls used by sentry marmots to 
alert the rest of their colonies to possible danger.

They live in colonies of up to 30, and hibernate for 7-8 months of the year in a shared 
burrow. Each colony has as many as 100 smaller burrows for summer sleeping and refuge 
from predators, with around 5 new ones dug per year.

Marmots are actually a type of squirrel. They are found in subalpine meadows and greatly 
enjoy sunning themselves on well placed rocks.

A population of marmots in China may have been the original natural reservoir of the 
Black Death pandemic in the 14th century.
