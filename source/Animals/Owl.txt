Spotted Owl

The spotted owl is an endangered Pacific Northwest species, under pressure from habitat 
destruction and invasion by the more aggressive and widespread barred owl.

They became federally protected in 1990, causing much upset in the affected logging 
communities. In the town of Packwood, interpretive signs about the history of the region 
argue how harmful the resulting restrictions are. I disagree, but then again my income is 
not impacted by owl protections.

Spotted owls hunt silently at night, mostly for small mammals such as woodrats and flying 
squirrels.

They have a slow reproductive rate, not even attempting to nest every year.
