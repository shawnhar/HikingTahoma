Black-tailed Deer

[Deer2.jpg]

Deer are often encountered along forested Rainier trails, especially if you hike at dawn 
or dusk when they are most active. They prefer the edges of forests where they can access 
grasslands and underbrush for feeding as well as cover for hiding and sheltering from bad 
weather. In summer, bucks move to higher subalpine regions while does and fawns stay at 
lower elevation.

They eat a wide range of grasses, ferns, shrubs such as salal and huckleberry, and twigs. 
It's a diet that tends more toward the delicious end of the spectrum in summer versus 
tough and woody during winter.

Columbian black-tailed deer are a subspecies of mule deer found west of the Cascades 
crest. They have all-black tails. On the eastern side of Rainier you may find other mule 
deer, which as far as I can tell are identical except that their tails are white with 
black tips.

All mule deer have large mule-like ears which they can move independently. This is 
undoubtably useful for focusing on any concerning sounds, but more importantly it's 
incredibly cute when they are listening inquisitively to a passing hiker!

Deer communicate through scent glands on the lower part of their legs, which can produce 
alarm scents, leave a scent trail where a deer has travelled, and identify individuals.
