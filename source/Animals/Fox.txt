Cascade Red Fox

The Cascade red fox is the rarest species that you have a decent chance of seeing if you 
spend enough time on Rainier.

In 2022 the WA Fish and Wildlife Commission listed them as endangered. The reasons for 
population decline are not fully understood, as there's still a lot we don't know about 
these beautiful animals. One theory is that warmer and wetter winters are allowing 
coyotes to range higher during the cold months, increasing competition and possibly also 
predation. Foxes do not hibernate or move seasonally lower, braving the full savagery of 
Rainier's subalpine throughout the winter months.

Paradoxically for an endangered species, foxes that have been fed by tourists can become 
begging nuisances around busy areas of the park. This is dangerous for them due to the 
formula: fox + vehicle traffic = dead fox. DON'T FEED THE FOXES, PEOPLE!

Within a single litter individuals may come out red, tan, black, or silver, but they all 
have black forelegs and a white-tipped tail.
