These handsome birds are the largest species of woodpecker found in North America. 
Requiring large trees, they inhabit mature forests across Canada, the eastern United 
States, and parts of the Pacific Northwest.

They eat mainly insects, especially carpenter ants, but will also eat nuts and berries. 
They will riddle a dead tree with holes in order to reach ant colonies, and can lap up 
ants using their long tongues (just like an anteater). They sometimes also forage on the 
ground.

Mating pairs excavate large nests inside dead trees, usually with multiple entrance 
holes. Each nest is only used for a single season. Once abandoned by the woodpecker 
family, old nests provide homes for other animals including flying squirrels.
