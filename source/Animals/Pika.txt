Pika

Pika do not hibernate, instead spending the summer cutting choice foliage, spreading it 
over the rocky slopes where they live to dry in the sun, and building up huge stores of 
dried plants so they can eat all winter inside their burrows.

They cannot regulate body temperature in warm weather, and may die if their surroundings 
reach the 80's. This is why they live at higher altitudes and seek habitat with plenty of 
underground shade options.

Although they look like mice, their closest relative is the rabbit.

Seeing pika always makes me happy, but they are shy so it's more common to only hear 
their calls. Rainier hikers will often hear a cheery &lt;meep&gt; &lt;meep&gt; when 
passing pika habitat such as a scree slope.
