Beaver

I have yet to meet a beaver in person, but have often seen trees that they've been 
gnawing at (e.g. near Longmire) and rivers they've dammed (e.g. along the Westside Road). 
They're big, big rodents (the largest in North America, and second largest in the world) 
who dramatically modify the landscapes in which they live by felling trees to build dams, 
for the dual purpose of creating lodges in which to live plus ponds in which to fish.
