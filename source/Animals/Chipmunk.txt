Yellow Pine Chipmunk

You can recognize a chipmunk by the stripes on each side of its face (three dark and two 
light) as well as its back (five dark and four light). If stripes are only on the back 
but not the face, you're looking at a <a href="GroundSquirrel.html">golden-mantled ground 
squirrel</a> instead.

Widely distributed across the northwest of America, you'll find yellow pine chipmunks in 
a range of habitats from meadows to forest. You're likely to see these active and 
inquisitive creatures foraging, begging, or cleaning themselves via dust baths and 
washing their faces.

Chipmunks do not build body fat before hibernation, so must wake periodically to eat 
stored seeds.

Unusually for a mammal, females are larger than males.
