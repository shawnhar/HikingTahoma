Hairy Woodpecker

[Woodpecker2.jpg]

Rainier's lush forests are packed with trees young and old plus many dead snags, and are 
therefore home to many hole-making birds including the hairy woodpecker, downy 
woodpecker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, and red-breasted sapsucker.

In all the years I've been traipsing around this mountain I have seen countless of their 
holes and often heard their drilling, but only managed to come away with this one overly 
zoomed photo.

The hairy woodpecker and downy woodpecker are an example of convergent evolution. The 
species are not closely related but cover the same terrain (most of North and Central 
America) and look almost identical. The hairy is larger than the downy, which means they 
feed on differently sized trees, so competition between the two is minimal even though 
their ranges overlap. Weirdly, both species show the same regional variations. The best 
way to tell them apart is length of the bill: the downy woodpecker's is short while the 
hairy woodpecker has a bill roughly the same length as its head.

Females lack the red head patch of the males.

They mostly eat insects, especially the larvae of wood-boring beetles, but will also 
consume berries, seeds, and nuts.

Mating pairs create nests by excavating holes in dead trees.
