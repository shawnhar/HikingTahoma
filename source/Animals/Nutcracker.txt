Clark's Nutcracker

One of many species 'discovered' (aka first described in English) by the Lewis and Clark 
Expedition, these beautiful birds are found across western North America at elevations 
between 3000' and 12,000'. They do not migrate, but change elevation with the seasons.

Although Clark's nutcrackers are omnivorous, the bulk of their diet consists of pine 
nuts. Each bird buries tens of thousands of seeds in the fall, and can accurately recover 
them even nine months later and when buried under feet of snow. Studies show that 
nutcrackers are better at remembering cache locations than any other animal, including 
humans.

Fortunately for the endangered whitebark pine, nutcrackers usually cache more food than 
they need. Unclaimed caches are the main way these trees reproduce. Whitebark pines could 
not survive without the long beak of the Clark's nutcracker because their seed cones do 
not open naturally. It's a remarkable example of mutualistic co-evolution where the pines 
both feed and depend on the nutcrackers, who in return behave in a way that grows more of 
their favorite food.

The Clark's nutcracker is currently classified a species of least concern, but may soon 
have to adapt its diet if the whitebark pine succumbs to the twin threats of blister rust 
and pine beetle.
