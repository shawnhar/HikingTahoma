Dragonfly

There are a LOT of lakes in Mount Rainier National Park. One source claims 385, but it 
all depends on how you count them. Anyone who has spent a warm summer afternoon lazing 
near a lake is sure to have seen dragonflies: iridescent happy zooming, so relaxing to 
watch as long as you're large like a human.

If you were much smaller, they'd be a terrifying predatory flying machine, armed with 360 
degree vision and two pairs of wings that inspired the 'thopters in Denis Villeneuve's 
Dune movies. They can fly in any direction (forward, backward, upward, downward, left or 
right) and have been measured accelerating through sudden turns with forces up to 9G.

Kinda like icebergs, we usually only see the few months after dragonflies emerge into the 
air, but they previously spent several years in an aquatic nymph stage. Dragonfly nymphs 
breathe through gills in their rectum, and can jet forward by squirting water out of 
their anus. They are voracious predators, eating just about anything smaller than 
themselves: bloodworms, other insect larvae, tadpoles, and small fish.

The way dragonflies mate is wild and complicated.

Mount Rainier is a participant in the Dragonfly Mercury Project, a nationwide effort to 
monitor environmental mercury contamination by having volunteers collect and test 
dragonfly larvae.
