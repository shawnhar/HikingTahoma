[Damage.jpg] Recommend checking WTA for recent trip reports before hiking here. In 2019, this spot was a road. In 2020 it was half a road. In early 2022, no road (but passable) and by fall of 2022 the damage had been repaired. This river changes the trail often!

This used to be a road, leading to a car camp at Ipsut Creek. But the Carbon 
River is subtle and quick to anger. Over many years it fought a series of 
skirmishes with the road, winning some, losing others, until during the 
floods of 2006 the river achieved a resounding victory that settled the 
issue once and for all. The road was defeated! The Park Service gave up, 
declaring this to be a trail henceforth, and Ipsut Creek was converted to a 
backcountry campsite.

Interesting fact: although most mountain rivers erode their valleys deeper 
over time, the glacier-fed rivers of Mount Rainier are undergoing a process 
called aggradation where their beds are <i>increasing</i> due to sediment 
from all the rocks and silt that get mixed up with glacier ice. This means 
the rivers are constantly braiding and changing their path, which is not 
good news for anyone hoping to maintain a road next to them.

I foolishly resisted exploring this area for years, thinking it's just a 
road, and roads are boring. I could not have been more wrong! After the 
first quarter mile the road is sufficiently eroded that it feels like an 
unusually wide trail. There are intermittent views over the rocky Carbon 
River valley, but that's not why you should come here. The reason to visit 
is the TREES.

The high rainfall and low altitude of this area combine to create a lush 
temperate rainforest, the closest thing to Fangorn Forest this side of the 
Olympic Mountains. There are nursery logs, giant ferns, moss-festooned 
branches, and so many shades of green that your eyes will forget the 
existence of other colors. It's probably just in my head, but the air even 
feels more oxygenated than usual. It puts a spring in my step and a sparkle 
in my soul.

The trail is long but level. Shortly past Ipsut Creek Camp (where the road 
used to end, so the trail narrows after this point) a short spur on the 
right leads to Ipsut Falls.

Ipsut means 'concealed' in the Chinook Jargon.

There are three side trips (marked on the map above but not included in the 
mileage) that can be combined with this hike, or which make worthy 
turnaround points for shorter hikes:

<ul>
<li>
Right by the trailhead, the concisely named Carbon River Rain Forest Nature 
Trail is an easy (but worthwhile) 0.5 mile interpretive loop.
</li>
<li>
One mile in, a sign on the right says 0.3 miles to Washington Milling and 
Mining Company. This spur is short but quite steep. It leads to an exploratory 
copper mine that was dug between 1907 and 1909 but never commercialized, 
perhaps because the company was mostly interested in using mineral claims as an 
excuse for logging inside the National Park. You can look into the mine 
entrance, but there's a grate to prevent venturing inside.
</li>
<li>
3.5 miles in, turn left for a 0.2 mile spur that crosses the Carbon River to 
Chenuis Falls. Assuming the footbridges are in, anyway. They wash away 
often. It's quite a river, that Carbon!
</li>
</ul>

Bicycles are allowed on the Carbon River trail (but not the side spurs) as 
far as Ipsut Creek, if you're the sort of person who likes that sort of 
thing.

This trail is also the first part of the [GreenLake], [CarbonGlacier], and 
[ChenuisFallsTrail] hikes.
