This short loop trail, located near Longmire, offers lush rainforest 
featuring giant trees, mosses, and nursery logs. I have only two nitpicks 
about it:

<ul>
    <li>Being short, and located near the busy Longmire/Paradise road, 
    there's no respite from traffic noise.</li>

    <li>What's with the name? There are dozens of magnificent firs along 
    this trail, not just two!</li>
</ul>
