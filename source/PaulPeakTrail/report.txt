Most visitors to the Mowich Lake area drive right past the Paul Peak trailhead on their 
way to the glories of [SprayPark] or [TolmiePeak]. It's the trail less travelled, a 
likely place to find solitude. I hiked it out and back without passing a single other 
soul.

Despite having the word 'peak' right there in the name of the trail, there is no summit 
to be had here. Starting from the pay area just past the National Park boundary along the 
road to Mowich Lake, the trail descends through forest, crosses Meadow Creek on a log 
bridge, traverses around the flanks of its namesake, then switchbacks downward as you 
enjoy intermittent views through trees over the South Mowich River and the icy slopes 
that feed it.

After 3.1 miles you'll reach a junction with the [Wonderland]. This would make an 
undistinguished turnaround spot, so the distance shown above also includes the short 
stretch of Wonderland down to the North Mowich River, which is a lovely place to eat 
lunch.

An unusual thing about this trail is that it starts high and ends low. It's also one of 
the lowest altitude ways to reach a remote part of the Wonderland, which makes it 
interesting for early or late season hiking. When I visited in May I experienced a form 
of time travel. I set out in winter, with a fresh half-inch of snow on the ground from 
the night before, and snowflakes falling around me. As I descended the air thickened and 
temperature increased, taking me through spring all the way to early summer as lower 
altitude enabled denser vegetation. This is primordial rainforest: mossy and dank and 
lonely and magnificent.

It's possible to make this hike into a loop, combining it with the Wonderland up to 
Mowich Lake plus [MowichLake] back to the trailhead. But this would only be fun at the 
right time of year: sufficiently off-season that the road is not full of cars, yet not so 
much that the Wonderland to Mowich Lake is impassable!

Speaking of road: as of 2021 the Mowich Lake road is a nightmare of potholes. Every time 
I drive this I tell myself, never again! But it leads to so many great trails, how can I 
not? It seems to get worse every year, but also seemed much worse on the way back than 
heading up, so I may just be repressing traumatic pothole memories and failing to 
accurately recall over time how close to a broken axle my poor car has really been :-)
