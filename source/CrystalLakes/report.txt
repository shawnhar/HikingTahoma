[Summit.jpg] I'm not out of breath, honest! Just stopping and turning around every 10 seconds to appreciate this marvel behind me :-)

This trail features two lakes with quite different characters, a rocky high pass, and 
excellent Rainier summit views. If you turn around at the lower lake, it's 4.6 miles with 
1980' elevation gain. To the upper lake but skipping Sourdough Gap is 5.8 miles and 2340'.

From the trailhead to Lower Crystal Lake is a forested hike. The path switchbacks up a 
steep hillside, continues past the [CrystalPeak] turnoff on the right, then straightens 
out as the incline eases and trees decrease in size. The lower lake is small, gentle, and 
lovely.

Between the two lakes you will find a host of wildflowers earlier in the season, or 
berries later on. This is the rain shadow side of the mountain, so plants are separated 
by patches of dry dirt, very unlike the dense vegetation of Rainier's south or west 
slopes.

Upper Crystal Lake is much larger than the lower one, and backed by steep crags. A 
sign indicates that the campsite is to the right, while the trail heading left around the 
lake is unsigned. Head left regardless, because the best of this hike is yet to come.

As you climb above the lake, Rainier's summit comes into view behind you. You'll want to 
turn around every few paces to marvel at how it continues to grow as you continue to 
ascend. Sourdough Gap is a dramatic place of jagged rocks, near which you'll pass a sign 
marking the edge of Mount Rainier National Park. Congratulations, you've joined up with 
the [SourdoughGap] trail!
