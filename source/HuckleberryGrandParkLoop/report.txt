I have not yet hiked this as a single combined loop, which I'd like to do someday, but I 
have separately visited all the pieces of it at different times:

<table class="photos showlinks">

    <td>[../HuckleberryCreek/Meadows.jpg|.|Huckleberry Creek]</td>
    <td>[../GrandPark/RainierFromGrandPark.jpg|.|Grand Park from Sunrise]</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
</table>

Closing the loop involves an additional 4.3 miles along Forest Road 73, which is not 
included in the distance shown above. This could be handled by dropping a bike at the 
Lake Eleanor trailhead, driving back to the Huckleberry Creek trailhead, and hiking up to 
Forest Lake for the night. Then on day 2, hike out via Berkeley Park, Grand Park, and 
Lake Eleanor, pick up the bike, and freewheel down the road back to your car.
