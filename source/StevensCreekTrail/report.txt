[Falls.jpg] Unnamed (as far as I know?) waterfall

This is an odd but pleasant little trail. It connects a picnic area along 
Stevens Canyon Road to the [Wonderland], but this connection makes no 
sense because the Wonderland directly intersects that same road barely a 
mile away. Starting at a picnic area suggests it could be a 
beginner-friendly family hike, but it's actually quite steep, and starts 
downhill which lays a cunning trap for the unwary :-)

What the trail does offer is pleasant forest, a lovely waterfall, and 
solitude. This was the first time I achieved my many-year dream of hiking an 
entire Rainier trail start to finish without passing another human being!
