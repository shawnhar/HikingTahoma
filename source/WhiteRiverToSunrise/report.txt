This section of the Wonderland Trail is focused on moving a few miles 
sideways and a couple of thousand feet vertically, lacking distinctive views 
or other notable features. I did it as an out-and-back day hike (the 
distance shown here is roundtrip) in response to an early September snowfall 
that had closed the road up to Sunrise while leaving the White River 
trailhead accessible.

Climbing through the snowy forest was lovely. I saw fresh bird and paw 
prints everywhere, including some that were definitely cat. It was neat 
having the usually bustling Sunrise parking lot entirely to myself.
