[View.jpg] I know I said mostly lacking views: this spot is the exception that requires use of the word 'mostly'

This section of the [Wonderland] is focused on moving a few miles sideways and 
a couple of thousand feet vertically, mostly lacking distinctive views. I did 
it as an out-and-back day hike (the distance shown here is roundtrip) in 
response to a September snowfall that had closed the road up to Sunrise while 
leaving the White River trailhead accessible. Climbing through the snowy forest 
was lovely. I saw fresh bird and paw prints everywhere, including some that 
were definitely cat. It was neat having the usually bustling Sunrise parking 
lot entirely to myself.

Early in the season this trail can be used to access Sunrise area hikes such as 
[FremontLookout] or [DegePeakFromSunrise] during the date window after they've 
melted out but before the road up to Sunrise opens for the year.

Beware a spot 2 miles above White River where the trail crosses a narrow slide 
area and then the base of a waterfall along the stream that drains Frozen Lake. 
This is no big deal in good conditions, but unsafe to cross when flow is high 
or if the waterfall is covered by a spring snow bridge.
