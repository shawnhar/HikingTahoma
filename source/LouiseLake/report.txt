This is so short as to barely even count as a hike. Louise Lake lacks the big Rainier 
view of nearby Reflection Lakes, and is correspondingly far less busy. You may well find 
solitude to enjoy the couple of nice sitting-rocks along its otherwise muddy shore.

For a bit more distance, start at Reflection Lakes and hike to Louise Lake along a 
pleasant and uncrowded mile of the [Wonderland] (shown as dots on the map above).
