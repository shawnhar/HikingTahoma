Most serious hikers think of this section of paved trail as the annoyingly crowded start 
or end of the [PanoramaPoint], but it deserves its own separate entry for an important 
reason: this is by far the most accessible trail on Mount Rainier. It's not completely 
flat, so wheelchair access requires either strong arms or a strong pusher, but nowhere 
else are such stunning views available to such a wide range of ages, fitness levels, and 
physical abilities.

For a slightly longer but still potentially wheelchair accessible hike, check out 
[NisquallyVista].
