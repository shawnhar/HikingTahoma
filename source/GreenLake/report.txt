[Reflection.jpg] A perfect place to sit and gaze into reflections

Hike along the relatively flat [CarbonRiver] trail for 3 miles through 
magnificent old growth rainforest. Turn right and climb for 1.5 miles, past 
the impressive Ranger Falls (viewpoint is along a short spur to the left of 
the main trail) to Green Lake.

This is a quiet, understated place. There are only partial views of the 
surrounding peaks, but they reflect most beautifully on the lake surface. 
It's a place for sitting and turning inward and thinking deep thoughts.

The low altitude makes this a great early or late season hike.
