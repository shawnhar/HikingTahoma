[-NotGreen.jpg] Not so green in late November :-) That's Arthur Peak to the right, Irish Cabin Peak to the left, and Tolmie Peak in the distance between them

Hike or bike along the relatively flat [CarbonRiver] trail for 3 miles, 
through magnificent old growth rainforest. Then turn right and climb on foot 
for 1.5 miles, past the impressive Ranger Falls, to Green Lake.

This is a quiet, understated place. There are only partial views of the 
surrounding peaks, but they reflect most beautifully on the lake surface. 
It's a place for sitting and turning inward and thinking deep thoughts.

The low altitude makes this a great early or late season hike.
