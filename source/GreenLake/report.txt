Carbon River status (having hiked there today):

The landslide that had closed the road to Rainier's Carbon River entrance was fixed a 
couple of days ago. There's a second slide right by the entrance to the National Park, 
so you can't drive all the way to the normal trailhead. This only adds ~100 feet to 
your hike, but there's not a lot of parking space along the sides here. It was fine 
on the Monday when I visited, but a plea: if we hike here, please let's all have backup 
plans in mind, and go somewhere else if there isn't room to park safely and without 
blocking repair vehicles.

The trail up to Green Lake has a few trees down, but is easily passable. The rainforest interpretative loop right by the trailhead was hard to get around, though: a big tree smashed up a whole section of the boardwalk, dumping the trail into the bog :-(

My third photo shows a spot where the Carbon River has an active disagreement with the trail, in between the Green Lake and Chenuis Falls turnoffs. So far it looks like the river is winning, as that wet bit right in front of me is supposed to be the main trail! I turned around here, but it seemed passable.

The bridge across the Carbon River to Chenuis Falls is out.
