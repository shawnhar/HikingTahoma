Emmons Glacier is a monster (largest surface area of any glacier in the 
contiguous United States!) and this trail is the perfect way to see it. Start 
up the [GlacierBasin] trail, but a mile past the trailhead turn left onto the 
side spur signposted for Emmons Moraine. Cross the Inter Fork of the White 
River, then climb briefly but steeply up the side of an old lateral moraine to 
a view overlooking the snout of the glacier.

You'll also overlook a lake filled by Emmons meltwater, which is colored 
turquoise by suspended glacial silt. I find it amazing to think how this water 
was only recently liberated from hundreds of years of deep freeze within a 
glacier, during which time it was slowly grinding rock down to ever finer 
grades of silt. There is no trail to the lake, but footprints show many have 
scrambled down to it.
