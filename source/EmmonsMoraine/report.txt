Emmons Glacier is a monster (largest surface area of any glacier in the 
contiguous United States!) and this trail is the perfect way to see it. Start 
up the [GlacierBasin] trail, but a mile past the trailhead turn left onto the 
side spur signposted for Emmons Moraine. Cross the Inter Fork of the White 
River, then climb up an old lateral moraine to a view overlooking the snout of 
the glacier.

You'll also overlook a lake filled by Emmons meltwater, which is colored 
turquoise by suspended glacial silt. I find it amazing to think how this water 
was only recently liberated from hundreds of years of deep freeze within a 
glacier, during which time it was slowly grinding rock down to ever finer 
grades of silt.
