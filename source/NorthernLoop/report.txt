The Northern Loop trail is a sibling of the [Wonderland]. It's shorter and less 
famous, but made from the same DNA and every bit as special. It encompasses 
more than one each of high passes, wild rivers, close encounters with glaciers, 
highs, lows, and the epic ascents and descents between them. Spanning both the 
east and west sides of the park, you'll get to experience the vegetation 
difference from rainshadow dryness to lush temperate rainforest.

Strictly speaking, the trail signposted as the "Northern Loop" is not a loop at 
all, but a 16 mile path which both starts and ends at junctions with the 
Wonderland Trail. It is most commonly combined with the northern section of 
the Wonderland, forming a 27 mile loop. There are no trailheads directly 
along this circuit, which is most easily accessed from Sunrise, adding 4.3 
miles out and back. Alternative access points are Lake Eleanor (+8.2 miles), 
Carbon River (+14.5 miles), or if you combine this with the [SprayParkLoop] 
to form a figure-eight, Mowich Lake.

There are two potentially dangerous river crossings along this hike: West Fork 
White River and Winthrop Creek. Both were the site of fatalities in 2018. Do 
your research, as conditions can vary greatly year-to-year (in 2018, the log 
bridge over Winthrop Creek did not have a railing) and try to reach these early 
in the day when river levels are lower.

I hiked the Northern Loop in early September, over four days going 
counterclockwise from Sunrise.


# Day 1: Sunrise to Fire Creek

<p class="subheading">8.8 miles, 1170' gain, 2930' descent</p>

The first part of this trail doubles as the [GrandPark] hike. From Sunrise, 
head to Frozen Lake, descend through a dry alpine landscape below the cliffs 
of Burroughs Mountain, then follow Lodi Creek down into the lush meadows of 
Berkely Park. Enter the forest, descend a bit more, refill water bottles 
while you have the chance because there's a dry section of trail coming up, 
then climb through forest to Grand Park.

The Northern Loop trail merely skirts the edge of Grand Park, but it's well 
worth a detour into this special place.  It's a flat open space created by an 
old lava flow, offering excellent views of Rainier.

Back on the main trail, you will soon come to a viewpoint over the valley 
of the West Fork White River. Boy, that's a long way down, and a long way 
back up the other side. Tomorrow, eh!

Into the woods, and downward. Fire Creek Camp is at the end of a 0.4 mile spur 
off the Northern Loop trail, so situated because this creek is the only water 
source for miles around. When I visited it was a mere trickle, but I guess 
"Fire Dribble Camp" doesn't quite have the same ring to it :-)

My campsite was slightly <i>too</i> well provisioned, with a lovely log seat at 
the base of a tree. Time spent reading while leaning against the tree made my 
back twinge. This is NOT the time or place for me to develop a back issue...


# Day 2: Fire Creek to Carbon River Camp

<p class="subheading">13.6 miles, 3930' gain, 5230' descent</p>

Woke up with my back feeling fine. Hurrah! But this will be my toughest day. 
Trepidatious.

First downhill, though forest, to the West Fork White River. This is a wild, 
remote place, and the river runs so white with silt that it looks more like 
clay than water. There are multiple channels. The first one had a log bridge 
over it but no railing. Yikes. Thankfully this was narrow, although deep and 
running fast. The second wider river channel had a nice log bridge with 
railing. Thank you, Park Service!

Then uphill, through forest and a cool/spooky burn zone, to Lake James, 
which is tranquil and lovely. Up some more, as the forest opens into meadows 
with views of jagged crags as I approach Windy Gap.

Now comes a dilemma. I'm already tired, and still a long way from tonight's 
camp. But there's a 0.8 mile side spur leading to the Natural Bridge. Do I 
really want to add 1.6 miles to an already long day? But on the other hand, 
it's not as if I'm likely to be in this area again anytime soon. If I don't 
put in the effort to see this now, when else am I going to?

Ok, I convinced myself. At first the spur is a nice level traverse with 
great views to the north (Cascades and Mount Baker). But then it heads 
steeply downhill. Dangit, I'm going to have to climb back up every one of 
these wasted steps! The Natural Bridge is worth it, though. Cool geological 
formation with views of Lake James and Lake Ethel below it.

Back on the main route, Windy Gap is an alpine wonderland of splendor and 
delight. It's over all too soon, though, as the trail settles into a serious 
descent. Down through the meadows, down through the trees, down to the 
ferns, then the mosses and the nursery logs, and hey, I've lost enough 
altitude that this is now a temperate rainforest.

This junction is the end of the Northern Loop trail. Hello, Wonderland! A 
quick hop and a skip over the Carbon River on a suspension bridge, and I'm 
at camp for the night.


# Day 3: Carbon River Camp to Mystic Camp

<p class="subheading">5.2 miles, 3140' gain, 850' descent</p>

"Only five miles", he says.

"This day is going to be easy", he says.

I don't know if it was fatigue from the day before, or if the trail 
following up alongside the Carbon Glacier was unusually steep, or if it was 
the heat and resulting sweat dripping everywhere, but my pace was glacially 
slow (ba-dum, see what I did there?)

Further up the trail enters Moraine Park, which is a wonderland (the puns 
just keep coming today, eh?) of meadows and marmots and summit views. Then a 
gentle downhill to Mystic Lake, at which point words fail me. I can find no 
more puns. Is this the spot where I want my ashes scattered someday? Of 
course not, because it's a fragile environment that doesn't need messing 
with. Meanwhile my soul says YES OF COURSE.

I can't put my finger on just what makes this place so special. The lake is 
large, and varies in color depending on which angle you view it. It's backed 
by interesting peaks in all directions, but no summit views unless you climb 
up to the nearby ranger cabin (which is a worthy extra 0.4 miles). It's just 
a perfect lake. A perfect place.

Mystic Camp is 0.2 miles downhill past Mystic Lake. I set up camp, ate 
dinner, then hiked back up to the lake to enjoy the sunset, only to discover 
my camera battery was flat and the spare was back at camp! Fastest 0.4 miles 
I ever ran :-)

It got windy during the night, so I didn't sleep well. Gusts kept blowing a 
super fine dust into my tent, covering all my gear and getting in my eyes. 
Where is this coming from? I would find out tomorrow...


# Day 4: Mystic Camp to Sunrise

I'd thought that yesterday involved getting up close and personal with a 
glacier, as I climbed up alongside the Carbon Glacier, but today exceeded it. 
Descending from Mystic Camp, I entered an otherworldly realm of moraines and 
meltwater rivers and the hulking, monstrous Winthrop Glacier itself. With each 
tap of my hiking poles the wind blew away a flurry of fine dust from the 
glacial till I was hiking over. Ah, so THIS is where all that mess in my 
tent last night came from!

Rainier trails are usually extremely solid and well maintained, but there was 
one sketchy section traversing down a slope to the upper West Fork White River. 
Footing was extremely loose, more just dust with a few rocks in it than an 
actual trail. The ground gave way beneath me with every footstep, and when I 
stopped to gather myself back together, pebbles continued to fall from the 
slope above me where my motion had shaken things loose. I made it down safely 
but did not enjoy this bit at all.

Next came a beautifully designed section of trail where the path follows down 
the ridgeline of a series of old lateral moraines. And then the Winthrop Creek 
crossing, which I had been worried about but was totally fine at 9 AM thanks to 
a solid bridge and low river level. I could see a still-wet section in the 
middle of the bridge, though, where water had presumably been lapping over it 
during the heat of yesterday afternoon.

Past the creek, the trail climbs while going through a series of ch-ch-changes. 
First, views onto the Winthrop Glacier. Second, up through forest. Third, the 
forest thins. Meadows! Summit views! Other views! It's Skyscraper Pass!

This is the highest point of my hike. Gorgeous in all directions (hey, that's 
Grand Park I can see over to the right) not to mention how incredible my last 
cheese stick tasted.

Now down, leaving behind the lush vegetation of the western slopes for the 
barren dry eastern tundra. Past the Northern Loop / Wonderland junction where I 
turned off three days ago. One final climb up to Frozen Lake, along 
Sourdough Ridge enjoying some final views behind me to my favorite mountain, 
and then back to Sunrise, my car, and a clean change of clothes.
