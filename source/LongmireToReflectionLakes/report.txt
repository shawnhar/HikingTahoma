The section of the Wonderland Trail between Longmire and Reflection Lakes is 
not typically considered one of its highlights, but makes a great off-season 
day hike. In summer this lacks solitude because it parallels the road for 
the first couple of miles, plus rejoins it a couple of times further up (by 
Narada Falls, and at Reflection Lakes themselves).

Early or late in the season, though, the road to Reflection Lakes will be 
closed for winter, and the main road up to Paradise doesn't open until 9 AM. 
Even after the road gate at Longmire opens, traffic volume is dramatically 
reduced compared to the busy summer.

Once freed from traffic noise, this is a lovely trail. Mostly forest, but there 
are great views from the Nisqually river crossing and of course at Reflection 
Lakes. Also multiple excellent waterfalls.
