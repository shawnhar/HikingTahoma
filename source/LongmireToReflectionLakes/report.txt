The section of the Wonderland from Longmire to Reflection Lakes makes a great off-season hike.  In summer it lacks solitude because it parallels the road for the first couple of miles, plus rejoins it a couple of times further up (by Narada Falls, and at Reflection Lakes themselves).  At this time of year, though, the upper road is closed for winter, and the main road doesn't open until 9 AM. Even once the gate at Longmire opens, traffic volume is dramatically reduced compared to the busy summer.

Freed from constant traffic noise, this is a lovely trail.  Mostly forest, but there are great views from the Nisqually river crossing and of course at Reflection Lakes.  Also multiple excellent waterfalls. It's 13 miles round-trip, with 2,500 feet elevation gain.
