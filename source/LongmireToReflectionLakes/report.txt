The section of the [Wonderland] between Longmire and Reflection Lakes is 
not typically considered one of its highlights, but makes a great off-season 
day hike (the distance shown here is roundtrip). In summer this lacks 
solitude because it parallels the road for the first couple of miles, plus 
rejoins it a couple of times further up (by Narada Falls, and at Reflection 
Lakes themselves).

Early or late in the season, though, the road to Reflection Lakes will be 
closed for winter, and the main road up to Paradise doesn't open until 9 AM. 
Even after the road gate at Longmire opens, traffic volume is much lower 
than the busy summer.

Freed from traffic noise, this is a lovely trail. Mostly forest, but there 
are great views from the Nisqually river crossing and at Reflection Lakes. 
Also multiple excellent waterfalls.
