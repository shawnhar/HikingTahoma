Across the Nisqually River from the main Longmire complex lies the Longmire Stewardship 
Campground. This used to be a car campground, but was closed to the public in 1989. 
Camping here is reserved for seasonal employees of the National Park, official volunteers 
doing work in the park, and Nisqually Tribal Members. The historic Community Building is 
also now closed to the public, but still used by federal employees for meetings and 
training classes.

Visiting in summer would be kind of a dick move because you'd be intruding on others 
(volunteer for the park if you want to camp here!) but in the winter it's a delightfully 
quiet place to snowshoe. There are several options for distance and difficulty:

<ul>
    <li>
        Over the Nisqually Suspension Bridge, past the [EaglePeak] trailhead and the 
        Community Building, around the campsites and back is ~2 miles with minimal 
        elevation gain.
    </li>
    <li>
        Continuing down Forest Road NF 5230-012 to the National Park boundary (not shown 
        on the map above) would be 3.2 miles roundtrip, still mostly flat. This road is a 
        spur off of NF 5230, which in turn is a spur off NF 52 aka Skate Creek Road which 
        connects Ashford to Packwood.
    </li>
    <li>
        Immediately past the Community Building an unmarked service road, which I cannot 
        find on any maps, heads east and uphill for 0.3 miles to a pair of water tanks 
        which I believe are the main supply for Longmire. Just before the tanks I noticed 
        a flagged path heading south, and I followed this for 0.2 miles (shown on the map 
        above). TODO: return and explore further to find out where this goes! It occurred 
        to me that the park might not want people recreating in an area which appears to 
        be a water source, but:
        <ol>
            <li>I saw no signs saying to keep out...</li>
            <li>I checked with the NPS who replied <i>"yes that is totally fine to explore and hike around"</i></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
