Eastside Loop
moderate 4 days

Ohanapecosh
Summerland, Indian Bar, Olallie Creek, Deer Creek, Tamanos Creek
2023

This loop hike is formed by combining the trails to [PanhandleGap],
<a href="../Wonderland/Day9.html">Ohanapecosh Park</a>, [IndianBar], 
[CowlitzDivideTrail], [EastsideTrail], [OwyhighLakesFromDeerCreek], and 
[OwyhighLakesFromWhiteRiverRoad]. Its lower, eastern half consists of quiet 
trails-less-travelled through primordial old growth forest, while its western half 
doubles as one of the most spectacular high alpine portions of the Wonderland. Closing 
the loop involves walking 3/4 mile along the road, which is included in the distance 
shown above.

I hiked it on a leisurely 5 day itinerary, which left plenty of time for side 
excursions along the way.


## Day 1: Upper Owyhigh trailhead to Summerland

<p class="subheading">5.2 miles, 2400' gain, 200' descent</p>

I began tentatively, because my back had seized up the afternoon before my trip started. 
It felt looser today, but I needed that problem to stay gone for this trip to be a 
success. I was walking carefully up the wide trail through the first stretch of majestic 
forest, loosening things up, seeking my groove.

After crossing Fryingpan Creek, the forest opened up as I got my first views and first 
wildflowers. Also an ego-boosting comment from a pair of passing day hikers who 
encountered me sitting on a rock to eat lunch: "you look like something out of an REI 
advert, with that big pack surrounded by flowers and the mountain behind you".

Onto the switchbacks, I made quick work of the climb up to Summerland. Ah, Summerland. 
The name is romantic, and the place even more so. I spent the rest of the afternoon 
wandering lazily from meadow to meadow, enjoying the huge variety of views, flowers, 
changing light, friendly marmots and ground squirrels.


## Day 2: Summerland to Indian Bar

[2-Bridge.jpg] I love the perfect minimalism of this bridge: exactly what is required but no more, simple, sufficient

<p class="subheading">4.7 miles, 1200' gain, 2100' descent</br></br>(7.6 miles including my [BansheePeak] side trip)</p>

The climb from Summerland up to Panhandle Gap is one of my favorite sections of trail in 
the whole world (although, see later). It quickly leaves the rich wildflower meadows, 
entering an otherworldly realm of barren rock, snowfields, streams, and meltwater pools.

The section of trail immediately before Panhandle Gap crosses a north facing snowfield 
that often remains challenging until late in the season. I visited right at the 
transition point where this had not yet entirely melted, but was small enough that folk 
were clambering around below it rather than attempting to cross the remaining patch of 
snow. It was a steep boulder scramble, thankfully short.

Today, Panhandle Gap was a weather divide. I had climbed in sunshine but found dense 
clouds to the south. Would my planned side trip that starts from here be worthwhile if 
socked in? I decided to take the chance: see my article on [BansheePeak] for details 
(spoiler, it was worth it).

Back on the Wonderland, the traverse across the high alpine of Ohanapecosh Park and then 
descent to Indian Bar was a misty, moody experience with much subtle shading of grey and 
rock but no big views to be had this day.

Indian Bar is, much like Summerland, just an absolute delight of a place. It's such a 
privilege to be able to spend a night here. The wide river valley is surrounded by 
waterfalls descending cliffs, and I had my own private viewpoint overlooking this from 
immediately behind my campsite.


## Day 3: Indian Bar to Olallie Creek

[3-WauhaukaupaukenFalls.jpg] On my way out of Indian Bar, today the bridge over Wauhaukaupauken Falls only has a wire railing on one of its sides, and one of the slats is missing: eek!

[3-Ridgeline.jpg] Ridgeline trails are the best

[3-Marmot.jpg] Sunbathing marmot is so bored with that view, they've turned their back on it
[3-Water.jpg] I need water! But the stream is dry :-(

<p class="subheading">6.1 miles, 1400' gain, 2500' descent</br></br>(7.8 miles including my [BaldRock] side trip)</p>

The sun was out. The views were big. The trail was magnificent. The day was great.

Remember how I said earlier that the section from Summerland to Panhandle Gap is my 
favorite of them all? I am reconsidering. It's possible that this part of the Wonderland, 
running along the top of the Cowlitz Divide, might be even finer.

First a climb, with beautiful views backward over the basin of Indian Bar. The summit of 
Rainier gradually came into sight behind me. Then all of a sudden, it's Mount Adams to 
the south! And the Tatoosh Range to my right, and the Cowlitz Chimneys to my left. Ridge 
hikes are the best, and this is a long ridge with a long trail running all the way down 
it. Undulations aplenty along the way, with always so much to see in every direction.

As this was a relatively short day, I decided to include a side trip to check out 
[BaldRock].

Back on the Wonderland, I descended into the forest, turned off onto the 
[CowlitzDivideTrail], and became thirsty. I knew there would be no water sources from 
Indian Bar to shortly before Olallie Creek, so had made sure to fill my full 3 liter 
carrying capacity that morning, but I sweated a lot during the scramble to Bald Rock and 
had drunk it all. By the time I made it to the first tiny trickle of a stream crossing 
the path, I was acting like the hero of an H. Rider Haggard novel who had reached the 
oasis after crossing the desert, flinging himself to the ground crying "Water! Water! 
It's not a mirage, we are saved after all!"

Olallie Creek camp is a quiet spot in the forest. The creek is small and visually 
unspectacular but runs right next to the campsites, providing a beautifully babbling 
background beside which to &lt;can't think of a synonym for sleep that alliterates here&gt;


## Day 4: Olallie Creek to Deer Creek

Every long trip has to have one day when you just aren't feeling it, and today started 
out trying to be that day for me. I was tired, and probably still a bit dehydrated from 
yesterday. I had a headache. I didn't sleep well last night. My camera broke. 
On paper this trail is just my kind of thing, deep dark primordial forest, but my mood 
was not where it needed to be.

Down the lower part of the [CowlitzDivideTrail] I went, to where it intersects the 
popular [GroveOfThePatriarchs] trail. I encountered odor-free day hiking families, and 
heard my first motor engine for 4 days. What a strange, unnatural sound that is.

A realization hit me. Grove of the Patriarchs has been inaccessible for a couple of years 
after a flood damaged the suspension bridge used to access it, but the level of the 
Ohanapecosh River was <i>really</i> low right now. Perhaps I could ford it? I scouted 
around. There were a couple of spots where others had obviously done that, but I didn't 
feel great about either of them. One shallow crossing spot would require damaging 
undergrowth to get from the Eastside Trail to the riverbank, while another offered easy 
damage-free access to the river but would take me into the Grove at a spot of dense brush 
where I'd have to damage plants to reach the big trees. Then I figured it out: enter the 
river at the lower location, walk up its bed for a few hundred feet, then exit at the 
higher crossing spot. I was in in the Grove, and I successfully Left No Trace while 
getting here! It's a truly special place, made even more so during this time of 
inaccessibility.

My mood was restored. Miraculously, my camera started working again.

Back on the Eastside Trail, the rest of the day was a long but oh so gentle uphill. 
Trees. Waterfalls. The big views of my first three days were replaced by closeup zooms 
onto small things and fine details. The color palette is reduced to endless shades of 
green plus brownish reds.

Trip reports from earlier in the year indicated many blowdowns affecting the Cowlitz 
Divide and Eastside trails, but they had all been cleared by the time I visited. All 
praise the repair crews for their endless labor keeping these trails in good condition!

Deer Creek camp is another quiet forested spot, and I had the camp to myself. It has the 
joy of being right next to several spectacular bathing spots at the confluence of Deer 
Creek, Chinook Creek, and Needle Creek.

<p class="subheading">8.6 miles, 2700' gain, 1800' descent</p>

This day was foggy, chill, and damp. The kind of weather where it's not exactly raining 
but everything gets wet nevertheless. Perfect conditions for a big climb through forest. 
I don't know how much it was due to the weather, getting a good night's sleep, or having 
the end in my sights, but I was feeling great, moving fast, found the right rhythm and 
just powered through the uphill.

The area around Owyhigh Lakes was beautiful in spite of the lack of views. I was sorry 
not to get to see the Cowlitz Chimneys one last time, but loving the variety of 
wildflowers I found up there.

A quick descent through a final stretch of forest, and... huh, that's my car!
