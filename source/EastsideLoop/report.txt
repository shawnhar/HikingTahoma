I have not yet hiked this as a single combined loop, which I'd like to do someday, but I 
have separately visited all the pieces of it at different times:

The lower, eastern half of this loop consists of quiet trails-less-travelled through 
primordial old growth forest. Its western half doubles as one of the most spectacular 
high alpine portions of the Wonderland, taking in the Cowlitz Divide, Ohanapecosh Park, 
and Summerland. Closing the loop involves walking 3/4 mile along the road, which is 
included in the distance shown above.
