In summer the Westside Road is something that you drive up for 3-and-a-bit 
miles before parking where it is closed to vehicles at Dry Creek, then 
hike or bike further up the road on your way to exciting destinations such 
as [SouthPuyallupPipeOrgan] or [GobblersKnob].

During winter, however, the road will be gated shut. You can hike, snowshoe, or 
ski (depending on current conditions) as far as you like up this wide and 
relatively level surface. Along the way you will notice weird and wonderful 
forest overflowing with moss and facehugger rainforest roots, multiple minature 
waterfalls, the steep slopes and occasional small cliffs of Mount Wow to your 
left, and partial views over Tahoma Creek to your right. These views are better 
than in summer due to lack of leaves on the intervening trees.

Upon reaching Dry Creek, which is the summertime trailhead, you have an 
obligation plus a choice.

Obligation: gaze up at Mount Wow, admire its cliffs and avalanche/debris 
chutes, and think to yourself "wow indeed".

Choice: turn around (fair enough) or go further (only advised if you have 
the expertise to accurately evaluate avalanche hazard, which can be 
considerable when passing below these slopes).

Mount Wow is named after the Yakama word for 'goat'.
