This loop combines the [EastsideTrail], southern half of [NachesPeakLoop], a section of 
the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) that skirts the eastern border of Mount Rainier National 
Park, and [LaughingwaterCreek]. It's a circuit of duality: ancient forest along the 
Eastside Trail and Laughingwater Creek, versus subalpine splendor on the PCT. Close-up 
attention to immediate surroundings versus big views. Solitude versus chatty thru-hikers. 
Inward versus outward.

Unusually for Rainier trails, both the Eastside Trail and this section of the PCT cover 
multiple miles without much elevation change, each being content to maintain the height 
they are at for extended stretches. This makes for fast hiking and encourages an attitude 
of settling in for the long haul, quite different from the constant variation experienced 
along something like the Wonderland.

Logistical details: camping along the PCT works differently from inside Mount Rainier 
National Park. Permits are not required there, so you can hike this as a 2 night loop 
with only one night booked at a Rainier campsite, but it is still important to practice 
Leave No Trace and camp at an established site, of which there are many along the trail. 
Be aware you cannot camp where the PCT dips inside the National Park, and the boundary 
signage nailed to trees can be easy to miss. Unlike Rainier campsites, PCT ones do not 
have bear poles (bring a canister, or be prepared to hang your food bag from a tree) or 
toilets (bury your poop, and pack out used toilet paper).

I hiked this loop in August, at the height of wildfire season when smoke from forest 
fires had turned the air hazy, making outdoor exercise unhealthy for those with impaired 
lungs and causing congestion and headaches for everyone. Tragically, smoke has now become 
a regular part of late summer weather in the west of North America. This wasn't a thing 
for the first decade I lived here, but since 2017 smoke has joined rain and snow as 
something hikers need to pay attention to. Breathing unclean air makes hiking more 
physically strenuous, and I'm finding it's much like rain in that, while I miss the 
distant views, haze can add a unique beauty of its own.


## Day 1: Deer Creek to Dewey Lake

[1-Rainier.jpg] My only Rainier view of this trip, before smoke haze intensified
[1-LookingDown.jpg] Looking down on Dewey Lake from Naches Peak
[1-SmokePlume.jpg] Eeek! Smoke plume from the Schneider Springs wildfire, 15 miles to my east

<p class="subheading">7.9 miles, 3200' gain, 1300' descent</p>

Trees, trees, and more trees along the northern part of the [EastsideTrail]: flat at 
first, then steeply uphill to cross the road near Cayuse Pass, entering the subalpine, 
and more uphill to Chinook Pass. It's the [NachesPeakLoop]! Solitude was replaced by 
small children and novice hikers, but I quickly left them behind as I turned off on the 
PCT and dropped down to Dewey Lake.

The lake is large and attractive, with multiple campsites tucked around its southern 
shore. Mosquitos were terrible, and only partially respectful of my picaridin spray and 
permethrin treated clothing. As evening arrived I could smell smoke in the air, and hoped 
I didn't make a mistake going ahead with this trip. There's no way home from this spot 
that doesn't involve covering some miles tomorrow.


## Day 2: Dewey Lake to Three Lakes

[2-Smoky.jpg] A moody, smoky morning
[2-View.jpg] If it wasn't for the smoke, this trail would have had many stunning views
[2-Huckleberries.jpg] Huckleberries offer the perfect boost to fatigued hikers: intense sweetness balanced with underlying acidity and such a rich burst of flavor for something so tiny
[2-Flowers.jpg] A few lupin left on the approach to one of many saddles along the PCT (flowers were mostly done for the year in this area)
[2-Trail.jpg] This section of the PCT is just a delight to hike along
[!2-Trail2.jpg] Smoke haze messed with my sense of scale, with peaks that I would soon pass by appearing distantly blue
[2-ThreeLakes.jpg] The Three Lakes are more beautiful than they look: green, tranquil, and a great place to watch dragonflies (that's my afternoon reading log with the water bottle on it), but hard to capture in a photograph
[2-Tent.jpg] Afternoon siesta inside my tent

<p class="subheading">9.5 miles, 1800' gain, 2300' descent</p>

What a delight this section of the PCT is! The 'crest' is of course a series of peaks 
rather than a single ridgeline, but the trail designers did a great job finding a route 
that traverses slopes and snakes across saddles from one side of the mountains to the 
other, gaining and losing small amounts of elevation along the way but mostly just moving 
sideways.

Most of the people I passed were chatty, and PCT backpackers turn my visual expectations 
upside down. I'm used to backpackers out for 2-10 nights being the slow ones carrying big 
packs laden with gear, while the fast moving people with small, light packs are day 
hikers. Here, though, the big-pack trudgers like me are here for a night by a lake or 
hiking the 28 mile PCT section between White Pass and Chinook Pass, but when someone 
zooms past me carrying seemingly nothing at all, that's a sign they started in Mexico and 
are on their way to the Canadian border. Thru-hiking the PCT in one summer is a race 
against the weather, so most travel fast and light in order to sustain 20+ mile days.

I found no water between Anderson Lake and Three Lakes, so carry plenty!

Turning off the PCT onto the [LaughingwaterCreek] trail, it's a steep 1.8 mile descent 
into forest to Three Lakes camp. It was hot at camp so I took a siesta, then spent the 
rest of the afternoon reading. There were curiously few mosquitos here, but the flies 
were annoying. It was a noisy night, with foxes yelping around my tent, and at one point 
a banging noise, about every 10 seconds, from some distance away. I have no idea what 
this was - possibly a bear attempting to get my food down from the pole? Something moved 
one of my shoes (which I left outside the tent) during the night.


## Day 3: Three Lakes to Deer Creek

[3-Laughingwater.jpg] Descending the Laughingwater Creek Trail
[3-SilverFalls.jpg] Obligatory photo of the famous Silver Falls
[3-Ohanapecosh.jpg] Looking over the Ohanapecosh River along the Eastside Trail
[3-Forest.jpg] Old growth solitude on the Eastside Trail
[!3-Bridge.jpg] Bridge over Chinook Creek
[3-Forest2.jpg] It's like a Jeunet movie: everything tinted green

<p class="subheading">13.8 miles, 2000' gain, 3400' descent</p>

Up and off early, as it was forecast to be a hot day and I had miles to go before I 
sleep. This was a long hike of quiet forest solitude, briefly broken in the middle by the 
crowds of laughing children visiting [GroveOfThePatriarchs]. The [LaughingwaterCreek] 
trail is a steep descent, while the [EastsideTrail] ascends so gradually that it feels 
almost flat. There were waterfalls. It was HOT. I sweated SO MUCH.
