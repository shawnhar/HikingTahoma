This is a great hike, I can't believe I never did it until today!   I combined the Van Trump Park and Mildred Point routes, for a total of ~8 miles and some decent elevation gain.  Highly recommend doing both while you're up there, as the views and terrain is quite different.  The Van Trump Park trail is only officially maintained for 0.3 miles past the split, but I continued around a mile down a clear and easy to follow way path.  This continued further, but I have no idea how far it goes.

There are a LOT of waterfalls along this route.  Comet Falls is the big 300 foot famous one, but I enjoyed many smaller falls along the way to it.  The sound of tumbling water is never far away.

Trail was deserted starting at 7:30 AM.  I went to Mildred Point first, and had it entirely to myself.  Met a couple of (lovely) people in Van Trump Park around 11, but only really hit the crowds past Comet Falls on the descent.  I think a lot of people only hike this trail as far as the big falls, so it empties out a lot past that.

Trail is in great condition, no problems at all.  Parking space is quite limited and people were crusing looking for spots by the time I returned to my vehicle (~1:30).
