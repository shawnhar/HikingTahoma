On sale, great deals, three for the price of one!

This hike combines a stunning waterfall, dramatic viewpoint, and rolling 
alpine meadows. Any of these alone would be worth the price of admission.

If you want to hike it in pieces:

<ul>
<li>Comet Falls is 3.2 miles, 1680'</li>
<li>Comet Falls plus Van Trump Park is 5.4 miles, 2770'</li>
<li>Comet Falls plus Mildred Point is 6 miles, 2900'</li>
</ul>

The trailhead is between Longmire and Paradise. Parking space is limited: 
cars were circling looking for spots by the time I returned to my vehicle 
(around 1:30).

The first part of the trail parallels Van Trump Creek up its steep-sided 
valley, and is crossed by several avalanche chutes. There are many neat 
river views and waterfalls, with the sound of tumbling water never far from 
your ear.

1.6 miles in, Comet Falls makes you wonder why you were bothering to enjoy 
the smaller waterfalls along the way. Plunging 300 feet, it's the closest 
Mount Rainier gets to looking like Yosemite.

Past the falls, the trail enthusiastically gains altitude through a section 
of forest. Once it levels out, you have a choice: turn right for Van Trump 
Park, or continue straight ahead to Mildred Point? Since you're already up 
here, it only makes sense to visit both...

The Van Trump Park trail is only officially maintained for 0.3 miles past 
the split, but I continued around a mile along an easily followed way-path. 
It's a glorious open meadow area, with views of Rainier to the north and 
Adams to the south. I saw mountain goats.

The Mildred Point trail loses a bit of altitude, crosses the river above the 
top of Comet Falls, then turns to the right and climbs steeply up a grassy 
slope to the Mildred Point viewpoint. This is a steep drop-off, so there's 
no option of going further. The view of Rainier's summit over the headwaters 
of Kautz Creek and the Kautz Glacier will recalibrate your expectations of 
what 'big' means, leaving you feeling tiny yet exhilarated.

Mildred Point can also be reached along the [MildredPoint] trail. That's a 
safer option in snowy conditions, and could be combined with this trail if 
you're able to arrange a car shuttle.

On the way back to my car, I hit crowds below Comet Falls. I suspect many 
people only hike this trail as far as the falls, so it thins out above there.
