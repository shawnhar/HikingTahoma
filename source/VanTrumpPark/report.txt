On sale, great deals, three for the price of one!

This hike combines a stunning waterfall, dramatic viewpoint, and lush alpine 
meadows. Any of these alone would be worth the price of admission.

If you want to hike it in pieces:

</ul>

The trailhead is between Longmire and Paradise. Parking space is limited: 
cars were circling looking for spots by the time I returned to my vehicle 
(around 1:30).

After a dramatic bridge over the top of Christine Falls, the first part of 
this trail parallels Van Trump Creek up its steep-sided valley, and is 
crossed by several avalanche chutes. There are many neat river views and 
waterfalls, with the sound of tumbling water never far from your ear.

1.9 miles in, Comet Falls makes you wonder why you were bothering to enjoy 
the smaller waterfalls along the way. Plunging 300 feet, it's the closest 
Mount Rainier gets to looking like Yosemite.

Past the falls, the trail enthusiastically gains altitude through a section 
of forest. Once it levels out, you have a choice: turn right for Van Trump 
Park, or continue straight ahead to Mildred Point? Since you're already up 
here, it only makes sense to visit both...

The Van Trump Park trail is only officially maintained for 0.3 miles past 
the split, but it continues much further becoming quite rough, steeply 
uphill and deeply rutted in places. This is a glorious open meadow area 
which transitions to alpine tundra as you gain altitude, with views of 
Rainier to the north plus Adams and St. Helens to the south. I saw mountain 
goats. The distances shown above and solid line on the map only cover the 
officially maintained trail, although I went 0.8 mile and 800' up the 
unmaintained trail portion, which is shown by the dotted line on the map. 
It's possible to continue further, but I'm told views do not improve higher 
up.

The Mildred Point trail loses a bit of altitude, crosses the river above the 
top of Comet Falls, then turns to the right and climbs steeply up a grassy 
slope to the Mildred Point viewpoint. This is a steep drop-off, so there's 
no option of going further. The view of Rainier's summit over the headwaters 
of Kautz Creek and the Kautz Glacier will recalibrate your expectations of 
what 'big' means, leaving you feeling tiny yet exhilarated.

Mildred Point can also be reached along the [MildredPoint] trail. That's a 
safer option in snowy conditions, and could be combined with this trail if 
you're able to arrange a car shuttle.

On the way back to my car, I hit crowds below Comet Falls. I suspect many 
people only hike this trail as far as the falls, so it thins out above there.

A quarter mile up the road past this trailhead lies Christine Falls, a popular 
roadside attraction that's worth checking out while you're in the area.
