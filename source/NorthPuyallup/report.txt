I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much from North Puyallup River Camp. This is one of 
the most remote campsites along the western side of Rainier, but it's also the end of an 
abandoned road (the group campsite literally <i>is</i> part of that road) which means 
artificially flattened areas and stone retaining walls. Not what we typically look for 
when seeking a wilderness experience!

Expectations: exceeded. The road remnants are actually quite beautiful stone walls, mossy 
and tastefully irregular. It's unusual in a sad, romantic way. The failed ambition of a 
past century (the road was originally intended to continue all the way to Mowich Lake) 
gradually falling into ruin and being reclaimed by nature. In between the individual and 
group campsites (which are on opposite sides of the river) the very end of the road makes 
a perfect hangout and meal spot. To the east are dramatic peaks descended by waterfalls, 
while below you the river plunges into a gorge beneath the sturdily constructed bridge.

Most people arrive at North Puyallup River along the [Wonderland] from Longmire or 
Mowich Lake, but for an overnighter it is more easily accessed via the Westside Road:

<ul>
<li>
    The easy option is to bike the closed-to-cars Westside Road to Klapatche Point, then 
    hike the 2.7 mile North Puyallup Trail. This last part follows a partially finished 
    section of the road, which was never opened past Klapatche Point. It is pleasantly 
    overgrown, with a narrow trail winding along the old roadbed and mossy retaining 
    walls protecting periodic views over the river valley.

<li>
    The boring option is the same as the easy one, but without a bike so you have to walk 
    the entire Westside Road. This is monotonous except for a half mile forested shortcut 
    on the Round Pass Trail, which is not an option for cyclists (look for the turnoff on 
    the right just before the Marine Memorial).
</li>
<li>
    The spectacular option is to turn off the Westside Road at Round Pass, cut across to 
    the Wonderland Trail via [SouthPuyallupPipeOrgan], then head north past 
    [KlapatchePark]. This section of trail is peak alpine Wonderland: ridgeline views, 
    meadows, and lakes with the curiously summitless western aspect of Rainier framed 
    behind them. The descent from Klapatche Park to North Puyallup is a series of 
    switchbacks with recurring views of some neat square-topped outcrops.
</li>
</ul>

The statistics shown above are for a loop combining the second and third of these options.
