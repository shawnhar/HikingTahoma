One spot, views of six volcanoes! This is definitely a hike to save for a clear day.

It's also a good choice for, if not quite early in the season, at least earlier than most 
at this elevation, thanks to a fortuitous coincidence of slope and aspect that often has 
it melted while other trails above 5000' are still buried in deep snow.

Not to be confused with Crystal Mountain, which lies a mile to the northeast and 
overlooks its eponymous ski resort just outside the National Park boundary.

The first 1.2 miles doubles as the start of the [CrystalLakes] trail, switchbacking 
steeply upward through forest. After turning right at the signpost for Crystal Peak you 
will descend slightly to cross Crystal Creek on a sturdy log bridge, then resume climbing 
while heading south as views open up over the White River valley to Rainier. After 
turning sharply left you'll ascend a couple of broad switchbacks up an open slope, 
followed by a final steep (but nontechnical) section of ridge to the summit.

From here you can see not 'just' six volcanoes, but also fantastic detail of the east 
side of Rainier: Dege Peak, Old Desolate, Burroughs, the White River valley, Goat Island 
Mountain, the Cowlitz Chimneys, and all the way across to Unicorn Peak at the east of the 
Tatoosh range. Or turn around for equally dramatic views over Upper Crystal Lake to 
Sourdough Gap.
