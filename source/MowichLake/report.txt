Driving along the dusty, potholed Mowich Lake Road is by far the least fun 
aspect of hiking to [SprayPark] or [TolmiePeak]. I gotta be honest, when the 
road is closed for winter so you decide to hike up it instead, that's a slog 
too :-) It's long, relentlessly uphill, and lacks views most of the way.

On the plus side, though, hiking this road in snowy conditions allows you to 
access Mowich Lake at times of year when it is otherwise inaccessible. I 
loved having solitude at what is normally a bustling campground, and seeing 
the patrol cabin and toilet building buried almost to their rooftops.

The length of this hike depends on snow level, which determines how far 
you'll be able to drive. Check recent WTA trip reports before you go, or if 
there are none, take a chance and then report back for the rest of us!
