Driving along the dusty, potholed Mowich Lake Road is by far the least fun 
aspect of hiking to [SprayPark] or [TolmiePeak]. And I gotta be honest, when 
the road is closed for winter so you decide to hike up it instead, that's 
pretty much a slog too :-) It's long, relentlessly uphill, and lacks views 
most of the way.

On the plus side, though, hiking this road in snowy conditions allows you to 
visit Mowich Lake at times of year when it is otherwise inaccessible. I 
loved having solitude at what is normally a bustling campground, and seeing 
the patrol cabin and toilet building buried almost to their rooftops.

The length of this hike depends on how far you are able to drive before 
reaching the snow. Check recent

reports</a> before you go, or if there are none, take a chance and then 
report back for the rest of us!

The Grindstone Trail is an optional shortcut that skips two major road 
switchbacks, replacing 1.9 miles of road with 0.8 miles of forest. It may not 
be easy to find in snowy conditions, although there are regular orange markers 
attached to trees along the route.
