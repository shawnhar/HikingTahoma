Driving along the dusty, potholed Mowich Lake Road is by far the least fun 
aspect of hiking to [SprayPark] or [TolmiePeak]. And I gotta be honest, when 
the road is closed for winter so you decide to hike up it instead, that's 
pretty much a slog too :-) It's long, relentlessly uphill, and lacks views 
most of the way.

On the plus side, though, hiking this road in snowy conditions allows you to 
access Mowich Lake at times of year when it is otherwise inaccessible. I 
loved having solitude at what is normally a bustling campground, and seeing 
the patrol cabin and toilet building buried almost to their rooftops.

The length of this hike depends on how far you are able to drive before 
hitting the snow. Check recent

report back for the rest of us!
