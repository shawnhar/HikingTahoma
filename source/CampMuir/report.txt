I have been intrigued and intimidated by Camp Muir ever since first falling in love with Mount Rainier, hiking the Skyline Loop, and wondering where that path heading on upward signposted “Pebble Creek” went. My “Day Hike Mount Rainier” book says: “It’s actually an alpine ascent that shouldn’t be attempted by people without proper training and gear. We include it here to warn serious hikers to go prepared, and, frankly, to dissuade the inexperienced and ill-equipped from going at all.”

So for years I did not go at all.

In 2017 I decided to hike to Muir as a challenge/celebration of having got in better shape. It was incredible. Physically intense and spiritually exhilarating. Pictures don’t do it justice – most of it wasn’t exactly beautiful, just awe inspiring, and my photography skills are not up to capturing such things.

A few stats:
- Nine miles round trip
- 4680 feet elevation gain
- High point 10100 feet
- Took me 4.5 hours to get up, and 3 back down

My Fitbit says:
- 31,863 steps
- Climbed 493 floors
- Burned 6,768 calories

There is construction on the road up to Paradise, but I got there early (hit the trail at 7) so it didn't slow me down any.  New road surface is super quiet, nice to drive in an electric car with the windows open.

It was sobering to see a sign in the ranger station about a couple of groups (one climber, one hiker) who are missing since last winter, somewhere up above Paradise.

There are still a few snow patches on the way up the Skyline Loop trail, but not difficult to cross.  I stopped for a first lunch (of three - this hike requires regular refueling) at Panorama Point.  Views were stunning as always, marmots friendly, and flowers are out although not as many as at Spray Park last week.  I ended up hiking the entire Skyline Loop as well as Muir, going around the east side on my way down, which added some distance but was easier on the knees, not to mention less crowded as I returned to the madhouse that is Paradise on a weekend afternoon.  Many people were getting confused crossing the second snow patch after the High Skyline section (you want to follow the wands downhill, rather than the trodden in traverse path).

But back to the Muir part. Past Pebble Creek, the hardest part was getting up onto the snowfield in the first place. There was quite a steep and slippery scramble up the first part of the snow, which I was not at all comfortable with and got me thinking I’d bitten off way more than I could chew. Luckily the rest of the snowfield was not like that.

It was pretty easy footing once on the snow. A clear path with footsteps already kicked in the whole way up (shades of King Wenceslas). I tried to do my civic duty and kick in some of the steps to help deepen them, but boy that was hard work! Other times I’d have to fall back on rest stepping, slow but steady. It was steep and went on and on and on and ON and ON.

I carried crampons, gaiters, and winter layers, but the weather was great so did not have to use them. Also ski pants, which I used for glissading on the way down. Poles and good boots were definitely necessary. I used lots of sun lotion, and wore a hankerchief over my head beneath a hat to hold it in place, which successfully avoided burning (well, just a bit on the back of my hands where I forgot to lotion) and kept sweat off my glasses.

I took 3 liters of water, which seemed about right. I would have drunk more if I had it, but I wasn’t dehydrated.

Glissading down the mountain was so much fun. Waterproof + slippery pants are necessary not to get wet and frozen. Some people had brought trashbags or even full sleds to ride down on, but I was fine just in my waterproof layer. The snow was sufficiently soft that I could only slide down the steeper parts, which was a good thing as I never had to worry about getting out of control.

It’s important to check out the entire glissade run before starting down one, though. One near the bottom ended in a big sinkhole that would have hurt if someone had fallen into it at speed. Also interesting that the natural fall line over the Muir Snowfield is diagonal to the direction of travel, and leads on to the Nisqually Glacier. The glissade runs all head that direction, but then stop and you have to walk sideways back to the main route. I can see how easy it would be to get confused in bad weather and end up on the glacier by mistake.

When I wasn’t sliding, I learned how to plunge step. That’s when you kinda half run down the mountain, letting your forward foot slide for a bit and then gradually dig into the snow. Gravity provides the forward energy while snow absorbs the backward impacts, so you can go quite fast with minimal exertion. Much fun, but only recommended on soft snow with no rocks!

There was not a lot of solitude on this hike. Which was a good thing, because it would have been spooky/scary if I was on my own. Everyone was friendly and had good hiking etiquette. I got to know the groups around me as we kept passing while stopping for breath. Nice people.

The upper mountain was chattering away all day, with the rumbling of avalanche after avalanche. I saw a couple of huge falls in the distance as I-have-no-idea-but-it-was-a-lot tons of ice came crashing down.

Highly recommended, but take this one seriously and don't risk getting lost up there!

I kept thinking, ok, looks like it levels out a bit past this next ridge, but it never did. Just alternated between very steep and really steep.
