This quiet, forested trail is often visited with an attitude of utilitarian purpose or 
even disappointment, rather than considered as a worthy destination unto itself. It's so 
rarely hiked for its own merits that it doesn't even have an entry on the Washington 
Trails Association website.

Many hike here as part of an [EastsideLoop], and I have to be honest: nice though the 
Cowlitz Divide Trail may be, it's definitely the least memorable part of that loop.

Every year some number of [Wonderland] hopefuls hike here on an alternative route around 
the mountain after finding themselves unable to get permits for the campsites at 
Summerland or Indian Bar. These camps are popular and limited in capacity, so they tend 
to fill up early in the <a href="../Wonderland/How.html">permit reservation</a> process, 
and once full they become the limiting factor on availability of full Wonderland 
circuits. It is however possible to circumnavigate Tahoma without camping at Summerland 
or Indian Bar, by detouring off the east side of the Wonderland via
<a href="../OwyhighLakesFromWhiteRiverRoad/">Owyhigh Lakes</a>, the [EastsideTrail], and 
the Cowlitz Divide Trail. A twinge of disappointment is inevitable for hikers forced onto 
this alternate route by lack of Wonderland campsite availability, as they'll be skipping 
a life-changingly splendiferous section of the Wonderland.

True disappointment would kick in for anyone who heard other hikers describing the 
Cowlitz Divide as their favorite part of Rainier, and hiked the Cowlitz Divide Trail to 
see it for themselves. Walking along the top of the Cowlitz Divide is indeed a marvel of 
big views and wildflowers, but that's the Wonderland section between Box Canyon and 
[IndianBar], not the Cowlitz Divide Trail at all! This confusingly named trail climbs up 
the <i>side</i> of the Divide, through forest with no views, and ends at a junction with 
the Wonderland about a mile south of where the epic pretty stuff begins. You could 
continue north on the Wonderland from this junction, but if your goal is the top of the 
Cowlitz Divide it'd be easier to get there from Box Canyon, skipping the Cowlitz Divide 
Trail entirely.

With properly calibrated expectations, however, this trail can be a delight. Although 
averagely steep for Rainier, the terrain rarely requires switchbacks so you'll be 
covering lots of horizontal as well as vertical distance. This results in a good workout 
that feels like you're stretching out and eating up the miles. Forested terrain makes it 
a good hike for bad weather, or for a hot day when you want to hike in shade.

And oh, the forest is lovely: peaceful, quiet, giant trees, and open enough that the 
undergrowth is luxuriant. Huckleberries will abound here later in the season. It's a good 
place to come for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHiN1rDnbiY">tree healing</a> 
when you're having difficult times.
