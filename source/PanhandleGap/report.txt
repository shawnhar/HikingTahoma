The section of Wonderland Trail from Fryingpan Creek to Summerland and then on 
to Panhandle Gap is among its finest. This is also accessible as a day hike, so 
the distance shown here is roundtrip. Turning around at Summerland would cut 
out 2.7 miles and 950' of elevation, but also miss the best part of the trail.

Parking space at Fryingpan Creek is limited, so it's a good idea to arrive 
early.

The trail sets out through a grand old forest, following alongside and with 
occasional views of Fryingpan Creek. After 3.2 miles it crosses the river and 
the terrain starts to open up with patches of meadow and partial views up 
toward the mountain. One mile and a handful of switchbacks later, you arrive at 
the famous Summerland backcountry camp.

Summerland is a gorgeous alpine meadow. It offers grand views upward to the 
mountain, views downward and outward over distant foothills, and close-up views 
of happily chattering streams plus of course the obligatory wildflowers. A most 
excellent place to stop, rest, eat, meditate, nap, or whatever else works for 
you. Also a fine place to turn around if you are done for the day.

For backpackers, Summerland is one of the most developed campsites along the 
Wonderland. The group shelter is an actual stone building, while the toilet is 
an actual covered outhouse! (usually a rather smelly one, though, due to the 
high volume of day hikers using it).

The final stretch of trail from Summerland to Panhandle Gap is where this hike 
elevates itself from good into the realm of the truly magical. Vegetation drops 
away as you ascend into a land of nothing but rock and water and strangeness. 
Snow patches linger through the summer, and can cover parts of the trail as 
late as August. Water falls down the cliffs above you, bounds over rocks in the 
form of countless streams, and fills turquoise meltwater pools. Some of the 
rocks are tinted pink and blue, to the point where they almost appear to be 
glowing. Other rocks are assembled into cairns, which are helpful for staying 
on the sometimes faint trail. Beware navigation if you're up here during bad 
weather!

Panhandle Gap is the top of the hike, and also the highest point on the entire 
Wonderland Trail. Immediately before it comes a traverse across a steep 
snowfield (still unmelted in September the last time I visited) where good 
footwear, hiking poles, and balance come in handy. Immediately after reaching 
it comes a massive exhalation of breath, as you take in the gloriously 
expansive view that has opened up before you.

For the few hardy souls who are still not done, the trail descends through 
the splendid Ohanapecosh Park, at first gently and then more steeply, before 
arriving at [IndianBar] 3 miles later and 2000' lower. Combining both of these 
sections, a through-hike from Fryingpan Creek to Box Canyon is 15.5 miles with 
4600' of climbing and 5400' descent.
