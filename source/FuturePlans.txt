Future Plans

I have completed my goal of hiking every maintained trail inside Mount Rainier National 
Park, but am far from finished with Tahoma.

There is one loop route which I've hiked all the pieces of at different times, 
but want to someday repeat all in one go:

<ul class="tight">
  <li>[HuckleberryGrandParkLoop]</li>
</ul>

My <a href="Wonderland/Campsites.html">Wonderland Trail Campsites</a> page should have 
photos of all the relevant sites. Still needed: Dick Creek, Granite Creek, Forest Lake, 
Snow Lake.

My <a href="Wildflowers.html">Wildflowers</a> page doesn't have a clearly defined end 
goal, but it should at least have photos of Kinnikinnick and Wild Ginger.

The dividing line between trails and unofficial routes is infinitely blurry. Rainier is 
covered with climber's paths, abandoned historic trails, and off-trail scrambles. Some of 
these will undoubtably prove beyond me, but places I'm interested in exploring 
include:

<ul class="tight">
  <li>Copper Mountain?</li>
  <li>Crescent Lake?</li>
  <li>Curtis Ridge?</li>
  <li>Elysian Fields??!?</li>
  <li>Goat Island Mountain?</li>
  <li>Mist Park?</li>
  <li>Pyramid Peak?</li>
  <li>Satulick Mountain?</li>
  <li>Tyee Peak?</li>
</ul>

If you know of any hikeable places (not climbing or scrambling routes) that I am missing, 
please <a href="mailto:shawnhargreaves@hotmail.com">let me know</a>!
