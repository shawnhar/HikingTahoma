Future Plans

I have completed my goal of hiking every maintained trail inside Mount Rainier National 
Park, but am far from finished with Tahoma. There are several trails that I've already 
hiked, but want to revisit because this website lacks sufficiently representative photos. 
It is the nature of trails to change with weather, season, and time of day, but I want 
this site to accurately represent the typical character of each. Places I feel I haven't 
yet achieved that are:

<ul class="tight">
  <li>[BurroughsMountain]</li>
  <li>[CarbonGlacier]</li>
  <li><a href="VanTrumpPark/">Christine Falls and Van Trump Park</a></li>
  <li>[GlacierBasinLoop]</li>
  <li>[GrandPark]</li>
  <li><a href="SprayParkLoop/">Ipsut Pass</a></li>
  <li><a href="NorthPuyallup/">Klapatche Point</a></li>
  <li>[MoraineTrail]</li>
  <li>[NaradaFallsLoop]</li>
  <li>[PaulPeakTrail]</li>
  <li>[SourdoughGap]</li>
</ul>

I need to add good photos of the Paradise Inn.

There are a couple of loop routes which I've hiked all the pieces of at different times, 
but want to someday repeat all in one go:

<ul class="tight">
  <li>[EastsideLoop]</li>
  <li>[HuckleberryGrandParkLoop]</li>
</ul>

The dividing line between trails and unofficial routes is infinitely blurry. Rainier is 
covered with climber's paths, abandoned historic trails, and off-trail scrambles. Some of 
these will undoubtably prove beyond me, but places I'm interested in exploring 
include:

<ul class="tight">
  <li>Andrew Benchmark?</li>
  <li>Aurora Peak?</li>
  <li>Bald Rock?</li>
  <li>Banshee Peak?</li>
  <li>Brown Peak?</li>
  <li>Copper Mountain?</li>
  <li>Crescent Lake?</li>
  <li>Elysian Fields?</li>
  <li>Green Park?</li>
  <li>Goat Island Mountain?</li>
  <li>Mist Park?</li>
  <li>Mount Ararat?</li>
  <li>North Backbone Ridge?</li>
  <li>Pyramid Peak?</li>
  <li>Satulick Mountain?</li>
  <li>Sunset Park lookout site and benchmark?</li>
  <li>Tyee Peak?</li>
</ul>

If you know of any hikeable places (not climbing or scrambling routes) that I am missing,
