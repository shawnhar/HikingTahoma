I hiked the Rampart Ridge loop in a clockwise direction, crossed over the Wonderland intersection, along the Van Trump trail to Mildred Point, back down Van Trump trail, and down the Wonderland to Longmire.   Total about 12 miles and 3,000ish elevation gain. Strangely WTA appears to be lacking an entry for the Van Trump trail connecting Wonderland and Mildred Point, so I'm unable to tag this report entirely correctly.

Much less snow than I was expecting.  The Rampart Ridge loop is entirely snow free!   Patchy snow started about halfway from Wonderland to Mildred Point, becoming deep in the last mile.  Good boot path, easily hiked without snowshoes and I didn't bother to put my spikes on.

Compared to the more typical way to reach Mildred Point via Comet falls, this route is:

Longer
More elevation gain
Less pretty stuff to look at along the way
Does not cross any avalanche chutes (which is a major issue for the Comet falls route in winter)
This was my first time doing the Rampart Ridge loop.  It should absolutely be hiked in a clockwise direction, so you're facing all the best views of the mountain.
