This is an alternative way to reach Mildred Point, longer and less scenic than 
the more common [VanTrumpPark] route, but with the advantage of avoiding the 
avalanche chutes which make the trail to Comet Falls dangerous in snowy 
conditions. I hiked it in October, when there was snow at the top but most of 
the way up was still bare.

Starting at Longmire, head north along the Wonderland Trail (which is also part 
of [IndianHenrysFromLongmire] and [RampartRidge]). At the top of Rampart Ridge, 
turn right onto the Van Trump Trail and hike up a forested ridge for 2.5 miles. 
Views open up in the last quarter mile, after which you turn left onto a spur 
that climbs steeply to Mildred Point.

Be sure to stop walking when you reach Mildred Point, because this is a steep 
drop-off! And beware of cornices near the edge if you visit here in the snow.

For a longer hike you could continue past the Mildred Point spur, up into Van 
Trump Park. Or, if you can arrange a car shuttle, you could combine this with 
the Comet Falls route (the two trailheads are separated by 4 miles of road).
