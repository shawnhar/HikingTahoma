<span class="trailinfo">This is a short unofficial route (steep, overgrown, and 
unsignposted) in a remote location that adds to its overall challenge. Only come here if 
your navigation is up to the task, and practice Leave No Trace to avoid damaging fragile 
terrain.</span>

How to get here?

<ul>
<li>
	If you already happen to be visiting [KlapatchePark] for other reasons, you're in 
	luck. The unofficial trail starts from the Wonderland a short distance east of Aurora 
	Lake, and it's only half a mile with 400' elevation gain to the top of Aurora Peak.
</li>
<li>
	If you're a badass endurance athlete, hike up the Westside Road, then up the St. 
	Andrews Creek trail, turn right into Klapatche Park, then left and climb up Aurora 
	Peak. This is the roundtrip distance and elevation gain shown above.
</li>
<li>
	If you're me, ride a bike up the Westside Road portion, which is 16.5 miles roundtrip 
	with 2100' gain. This reduces the hike up the St. Andrews Creek trail and Aurora Peak 
	to just 6 miles with 2300' gain.
</li>
</ul>

There was clearly once an official trail here (evidence: wooden inserts attempting to 
control erosion) but it has clearly not been maintained for many years (evidence: much 
erosion, deep rutting, pine trees growing into the trail). This route dates from before 
the popularity of switchbacks, being brutally direct and steep. It is important to stay 
on the established path, challenging though that is at times, to avoid damaging plants in 
this fragile habitat.

Views from the top are great, but not notably different vs. what you can see from nearby 
sections of the Wonderland.
