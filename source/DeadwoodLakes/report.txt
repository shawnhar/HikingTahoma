I can find this unofficial trail on no maps, and it's not mentioned in most 
books, but it does have an entry on the Washington Trails Association 
website. I learned about it from the excellent but little-known book, "Mt. 
Rainier Trails" by Paul Hodge (who, like me, set himself a mission to hike 
and write about <i>all</i> the trails in Mount Rainier National Park rather 
than only the popular ones).

Actually, let me directly quote Paul's intro to these lakes:

<i>"What are the Deadwood Lakes doing in this trail book? They're not on a 
maintained trail, they're not in the guidebooks and hardly anyone's ever 
heard of them. Well, that's why they're here. These two charming lakes are 
at the head of a small quiet valley, hidden from the crowds of Chinook Pass 
by an intervening ridge. They are not well known in spite of being only a 
mile and a half from a busy trail thoroughfare. Finding them is tricky but 
it's worth the effort as there is likely to be solitude along the way and on 
their sandy shores."</i>

Well, I found them, and it was worth the effort. Thank you Paul! The shores 
were more mud than sand at the time of my visit though.

From Chinook Pass, follow the Pacific Crest Trail north for half a mile 
along the [SourdoughGap] route. Turn left at an unmarked junction, climb to 
the saddle east of Deadwood Peak, then descend to a pair of lakes.

As of 2021 the path was easy to follow with no navigational challenges. Some 
kind soul had even placed branches to mark the correct route where 
intersections with game trails could be confusing. There were several 
blowdowns but none difficult to step across. Plenty of shrubbery and tree 
branches growing across the trail, so expect to spend much of the time 
pushing foliage out of your way. The trail is very steep in places, 
eschewing switchbacks in favor of a direct ascent.

Hikers who are comfortable with a bit of scrambling will find the distance 
and elevation gain of this trail pretty easy, but the roughness of the trail 
will not feel easy to others. Luckily the steepest section with most 
exposure occurs almost immediately after separating from the PCT, so you can 
quickly determine whether the trail is a good fit for you.
