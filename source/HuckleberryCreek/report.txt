The Huckleberry Creek trail is long and lonely. It's one of the older trails in the park, 
being shown on a <a href="http://npshistory.com/brochures/mora/1919.pdf">1919 map</a> 
from back before Sunrise even existed, and one of the least visited.

Due to the length of this trail it is often done as a through-hike, either uphill to 
Sunrise (which is the elevation gain shown above) or downhill starting at Sunrise (which 
was my choice: only 600' elevation gain, but still strenuous due to the 4100' descent). 
The nuisance of shuttling cars to both ends of the trail can be greatly reduced if a 
trail angel offers a lift from one to the other: thanks again Mary!

The lower trailhead lies along Forest Road 73, which as of 2022 was mildly potholed but 
no problem for my low clearance electric car. This end of the trail would make a great 
shoulder season forest hike. The gradient is mellow, while streams and giant trees 
abound. The trail covers one mile of National Forest land before entering the National 
Park near a disused patrol cabin.

At the other end of the trail, Sunrise is a madhouse of people heading to 
[FremontLookout] or [BurroughsMountain], but after 0.85 miles hiking west along Sourdough 
Ridge, a magical thing happens. Turn north onto the Huckleberry Creek trail, and, where 
did everyone else go? The trail climbs improbably toward what looks like a small peak 
along the ridge but is actually a way over it. In just a few hundred feet, I somehow went 
from a bazillion fellow hikers to zero. Silence. Complete solitude. Less than a mile from 
the Sunrise parking lot. This trail is great!

There are no Rainier summit views after you cross the top of Sourdough Ridge, but views 
to the north make up for that as you descend through a rocky glacial cirque into 
wildflower meadows and then the forested lower part of the trail.

A bit south of Forest Lake the trail crosses a slide area, going right over a giant 
tangle of pulverized trees. This was easy enough as of 2022, but quite intimidating to 
imagine what happened to create it. My best guess is a huge avalanche came off the slopes 
to the west, flowed right across the meadow below the trail, and ended here leaving all 
the debris that was carried with it.
