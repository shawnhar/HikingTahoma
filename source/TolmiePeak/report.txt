I've been wanting to check out the Tolmie lookout for a while, but was intimidated by the busyness of this popular trail.  So I figured, why not go early to beat the crowds?

I hit the trail at 4 AM, leaving myself plenty of time to get up to the top before dawn (which is a little after 6 right now).  This was my first time hiking through woods at night, which turned out to be fun but spooky, as my headlamp lit up the tips of branches from only the closest trees making the forest behind seem impenetrably black.

View from the top are truly stunning.  This is not just a good viewpoint, but a beautifully well-composed one, with Rainier close enough to look detailed yet far enough away to remain a well-composed entity, Mother Mountain framing its base, and Eunice Lake to provide a splash of foreground contrast.  Clouds rolled in and out while I was up there, alternating between stunning dawn views, rivers of cloud, and full fog white-out.  I stayed about an hour taking this all in.

Still no solitude though!  Even at my early hour there were a couple of people already at the top taking photos, and many more coming up the trail on my way out who must have started right at first light.  By 9:00, parking was already way back along the road.

But oh yes: the trail.  It's in good condition and a pleasant hike, but not especially distinguished most of the way up.  Flowers mostly done for the year. The payoff really comes from the top on this one.
