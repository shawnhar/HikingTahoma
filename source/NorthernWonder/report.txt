I first hiked the [NorthernLoop] in 2020, followed by the [Wonderland] in 2021. In 2024, 
my friend Frank, founder of the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/675281582581927">Wonderland Trail Facebook group</a>,
invited me to join him on this combination of both trails. We hiked a leisurely 14 day 
circuit starting in late August, going counterclockwise from White River and including 
the Spray Park alternate route.


## Day 1: White River to Berkeley Park

<p class="subheading">7.0 miles, 2600' gain, 1300' descent</p>

I pulled into the White River parking lot at 9 AM on the dot, met up with Frank, and we 
hit the trail. The day was cool and cloudy. Packs were heavy. Company was great, but 
conversation limited by lack of spare breath as we settled into an uphill hiking groove. 
No allowance for warming up here - the ascent is relentless right from the start.

A few thousand feet higher, we turned onto the gentler and wider Sunrise Rim trail, 
passed the five way junction at Frozen Lake, descended into Berkeley Park, turned off the 
Wonderland onto the Northern Loop trail, descended some more, then set up camp for the 
night. Along the way we enjoyed seeing spectacular wildflowers, marmots, mountain goats, 
day hikers, and a bear.

We were woken at midnight by torrential rain, electric flashes, and booming explosions 
that sounded like they were rolling past us up the valley, echoing back off the cliffs to 
create an awesome surround sound effect. The storm lasted at least half an hour: yee haw!


## Day 2: Berkeley Park to James Camp

<p class="subheading">8.0 miles, 1900' gain, 3000' descent</p>

Another chill, damp day, although the storm had passed by the time we got up in the 
morning. After a short climb we strolled through the majestic flat open area known as 
Grand Park (where it was too cloudy for any views today), passed the scenic overlook of 
the West Fork White River (allegedly, as it was too cloudy to see anything there today), 
lost a ton of altitude descending through forest to said river, crossed it while feeling 
thankful that log bridges were in today (as this would otherwise be a challenging ford), 
then regained a bunch of altitude climbing through more forest to reach our camp.

The theme of today was huckleberries, which were in prime season throughout our trip. 
It's so benevolent of the mountain to offer both sustenance and an excuse to stop and 
catch your breath, growing conveniently at hand height right next to the trail. There are 
many varieties, some interchangeably described as blueberries while others are bright red 
in color. There are the darker purplish blue ones, with rich flavor like a cello playing 
a C# with heavy vibrato. Also the lighter blue/grey berries that have an almost velvety 
sheen and taste brighter, like woodwinds sustaining a minor sixth chord. Later on we will 
find the higher altitude varieties, which grow in low mats and are shyer, tucking away 
indescribably sweet berries beneath their leaves. We experiment with various 
combinations. A single berry proves too little to get the full impact. A handful of 5-10, 
sometimes mixing cellos with woodwinds, provides the perfect explosion of juicy vigor in 
the mouth.


## Day 3: James Camp to Carbon River Camp

[3-Forest.jpg] Setting out through a wet forest
[3-WetLeaves.jpg] I can't decide if I'm getting wetter from the rain that falls from above, or from constantly brushing against wet foliage

[3-Camped.jpg] A wet camp at Carbon River

<p class="subheading">7.3 miles, 2100' gain, 3400' descent</p>

Ok, rain. This has been nice and all, but enough is enough. All our gear is damp. We're 
having conversations about how we're still ok for now, but if we don't get a chance to 
dry out soon we're going to be approaching trip-ending levels of wetness.

Uphill to Windy Gap, which was definitely windy and I have to assume also a gap although 
it was too misty to see for sure. Near the top I saw what I thought was the silhouette of 
a bear, a few hundred feet ahead on the trail. Stopping to watch, we realized it was too 
big and stationary for a bear, so must just be a rock. Then the rock got up and walked 
off.

For years I have been equally intrigued and intimidated by the idea of someday visiting 
the remote area called Elysian Fields, which is reached via the pass between Crescent and 
Sluiskin mountains. I was hoping to scope that out while passing by today, but with this 
weather we saw it not. We did however meet two separate rangers during this trip who both 
described the climb as hard but not as bad as it looks from below.

Anyways. We go down. And down. And down some more, into the depths of the Carbon 
rainforest where we walk sideways for a couple of final miles, rejoin the Wonderland 
after finishing the Northern Loop section, cross a suspension bridge, and crawl into our 
tents to cook dinner under the vestibule. Damp sleeping bag. Soggy socks.


## Day 4: Carbon River Camp to Eagle's Roost

<p class="subheading">6.5 miles, 3300' gain, 1700' descent</p>

What is this I wake up to? Can it really be? YES! Sunshine!!! We are saved!!!!!!

The sun doesn't last all day, as clouds end up covering much of Spray Park, but the trend 
is reversed: we're no longer getting wetter, and some things even manage to get a bit 
drier.

This is a big climb day, up through Seattle Park into a desolate high landscape of rocks 
and cairns with even a tiny remaining bit of snowfield to cross, then down through Spray 
Park which remains beautiful despite the cloudy weather and wildflowers being mostly 
finished for the year.

My knee is bugging me. It's creaking when I climb, and hurting when I descend. Urgh. Not 
bad enough to be a major problem yet, but I'm worried enough about it to be thinking 
about how Mowich tomorrow will be the last good bailout point before we set off down the 
remote west side of the mountain.


## Day 5: Eagle's Roost to South Mowich River

[5-Tahoma.jpg] Whodathunk it, apparently we're walking around a volcano? First proper sight of her this trip!

[5-Camped.jpg] Camped inside the log shelter at South Mowich River

<p class="subheading">6.4 miles, 900' gain, 2900' descent</p>

A short, easy day, almost a rest stop. After a couple of levelish miles across to Mowich 
Lake, we spread everything out to thoroughly dry, pick up our resupply buckets from the 
ranger cabin, and hang out relaxing for hours. B and A and S visit, bringing treats 
including lemonade, fresh bread, mozzarella, and SALAD OH MY GOD YES! It's so fresh and 
crunchy and great. We go for a swim, and it's lovely to be reminded of things beyond this 
narrow intense time of my being away doing Mountain.

We leave Mowich midafternoon, feeling great that gear is solidly dry all the way through 
for the first time in days. We're carrying excess water because we know there'll be no 
good source at our camp for tonight, with the next opportunity being on the far side of 
the river beyond where we're stopping. We quickly drop several thousand feet through 
forest to the valley floor, cross the North Mowich River on a convenient log bridge 
(thanks, trail crew!) and nab campsite #1, which is a log shelter rather than the usual 
open patch of ground. Wary of mice, we set up tents inside the shelter.

It's a cool but strange place to sleep, with light only reaching my tent from one side 
and a second roof keeping my tent dry when it rains during the night. My knee feels 
better. I fall asleep to a jumble of thoughts about closeness, distance, independence, 
and flourishing.


## Day 6: South Mowich River to Golden Lakes

[6-Camped.jpg] Camped at Golden Lakes

<p class="subheading">5.8 miles, 2400' gain, 200' descent</br></br>9.2 miles including my [SunsetPark] side trip</p>

A short day in miles, but the climb is relentlessly brutal. First, though, a river 
crossing. The South Mowich River is notoriously temperamental, dislikes bridges, and is 
constantly hopping out of its channel as it changes its mind about where it wants to 
flow. A few years ago it somehow ended up merging with the North Mowich River somewhere 
upstream, confusing everyone who had the crossing on the south side of camp down as the 
more difficult of the two, but this year the water is back in more or less its usual 
place. We find two main channels here today, luckily both with solid log bridges in place.

This valley is home to the kind of old growth that other rainforests aspire toward while 
feeling perhaps a bit intimidated by it. I wouldn't say it's exactly hostile to human 
life, just indifferent: older and vaster.

But we climb, leaving the rainforest behind. Huckleberries come to our rescue as lungs 
are working hard. We make it to camp early, while gathering clouds threaten squalls.

The water source at Golden Lakes is the lake, but filtering from the obvious spot behind 
the ranger cabin would be silty. Better to head left, over the rocky outcrop to where 
there's a nice clean place both to filter and to swim (although it was too cold for me to 
want to swim today).

With so much of the day left, I decide to take a side trip up to [SunsetPark]. I sit up 
there for quite some time while hailstones fall intermittently around me, feeling 
fantastic. I'm in an obscure, remote place, all on my own with questionable weather, but 
am equipped with the right knowledge and gear for it. I know this mountain so well now 
that I had no hesitation about finding my way up here without referring to map or 
compass. It's my mountain and I feel like I belong here.

Back in camp, we enjoy a glorious sunset with views out over the Puget Sound lowlands. 
Later in the night it hails heavily, but we're in a great mood, shouting "oh yeah!" back 
and forth between our tents as they are pummeled by falling ice.


## Day 7: Golden Lakes to Klapatche Park

<p class="subheading">7.7 miles, 2500' gain, 2000' descent</p>

Now THIS is what the Wonderland is all about. A big day, with big views. The mountain is 
out. Also too the sun.

It's cold as we set out along the first couple of level miles, frost crunching underfoot 
through Sunset Park. Then a big descent to the North Puyallup River, where we spread out 
tents to dry from last night's hailstorm while we eat lunch.

And then a big climb, up one of the rougher sections of the entire Wonderland. The trail 
is steep, narrow, brushy, and rooty. You can tell we're on the wet side of the mountain 
because Devil's Club, normally a bog plant, grows way up the sides of this valley.

We carried water up from North Puyallup, because the water source at Klapatche is Aurora 
Lake which at this time of year becomes shallow, silty, and full of tadpoles.

Klapatche Park has me pinching myself to make sure it's really true that I get to camp in 
such an amazing special place. This is our halfway point! For the first time this trip, 
the weather is good enough that other hikers gather for the evening, sitting on logs to 
eat dinner and watch sunset on the mountain reflected in Aurora Lake while goats and a 
bear forage on Aurora Peak above us. We chat and share stories.

Getting to hear the stories of other hikers was a highlight of this trip for me. Powerful 
things about celebration, adventure, grief, family, challenge, and loneliness. I will not 
share details here as they aren't my tales to tell.


## Day 8: Klapatche Park to South Puyallup River

<p class="subheading">4.1 miles, 800' gain, 2100' descent</br></br>5.4 miles including my [AndrewBenchmark] side trip</p>

Another day, another trail section full of wonders. First along and up a bit to St. 
Andrews Lake, where I swim (brrrr, refreshing). Then a side trip to [AndrewBenchmark]. 
Finally a forested descent to camp for the night, which is a happy place of big trees and 
moss and cool lava rock formations. I find myself without much to say about it other than 
that life is good.

Water was just a trickle here at South Puyallup. After it dries up later in the season, 
the next good source is a half mile further up the trail toward Emerald Ridge.


## Day 9: South Puyallup River to Pyramid Creek

[9-SteepRidge.jpg] The climb up to Emerald Ridge is narrow and precarious feeling in places

[9-Camped.jpg] Camped at Pyramid Creek

<p class="subheading">9.0 miles, 2800' gain, 3300' descent</p>

This was one of our harder days, featuring two big climbs and matching descents. First up 
to Emerald Ridge, then down to Tahoma Creek which is crossed on a suspension bridge, then 
up to Satulick's Hunting Grounds, then down again to camp.

The climb to Emerald Ridge runs up a sometimes narrow and exposed ridgeline with loose rocks 
underfoot. It demands concentration and made me nervous in places. Call me a wuss if you 
will, but this section makes my butt clench.

Descending from Emerald Ridge toward the suspension bridge, we enter a hot, dry, desolate 
landscape. Piles of rock and a few struggling plants below the slumped and broken side of 
Tahoma. It makes me want to ask: you poor mountain, what happened to you here? And then I 
see the high headwalls with all that obviously missing rock, and remember how countless 
lahars have pummeled this area over the centuries. We're looking at a combination of 
their damage plus the moraines left after recent glacial retreat.

To anyone thinking back on my first paragraph and wondering isn't that place actually 
called Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds, I say that his name wasn't Henry. We know full 
well that he was called Satulick, so I'm attempting to be the change I want to see in the 
world and start using a more appropriate name for his beautiful namesake meadows.


## Day 10: Pyramid Creek to Paradise River

<p class="subheading">6.9 miles, 1600' gain, 1500' descent</p>

This day is dominated by a single idea: french fries. Crispy golden fried strips of 
potato, with just the perfect amount of salt, perhaps dipped in ketchup. Heavenly aroma 
of sizzling starches.

We're fantasizing loudly about fries as we leave camp and cross Kautz Creek, which this 
year is a somewhat gnarly river with two main braids and no bridges. Something must have 
shifted upstream, because in past years I remember the adjacent Pyramid Creek having more 
water in it while Kautz Creek was barely a trickle. I swap my trail runners for water 
shoes and ford carefully, while Frank prefers to cross feet-dry via a fallen log and some 
rock hopping.

A short climb up to Rampart Ridge, then a longer descent into Longmire. It's our resupply 
day! Cache bucket pickup at the ranger station followed by lunch at the National Park 
Inn. The service there is pretty slow, with a mellow, relaxed mood, and the hot food is a 
delicious treat.

Back on the trail, it is SO hot this afternoon. We sweat, and climb, and swelter, and 
climb. I start to wonder whether those two beers at lunch could have been a mistake. The 
trail is wide here, practically a highway. It runs alongside an old conduit that used to 
carry water to a small hydroelectric plant, fascinatingly constructed from wooden staves 
surrounded by metal hoops, like a massively elongated wine barrel.

Paradise River is a small, quiet camp tucked away in the forest. The river, below camp 
and a few hundred feet further along the trail, is a wonderfully cool spot to filter 
water and hang out with other hikers.

[11-Camped.jpg] Camped at Nickel Creek

<p class="subheading">10.9 miles, 2500' gain, 3100' descent</p>

Our longest day in miles (although not elevation) is dominated by waterfalls rather than 
big views. It's another hot one. I sweated buckets.

First a big climb up to Reflection Lakes, past Carter Falls, Madcap Falls, and Narada 
Falls. At Reflection Lakes we intersect the road, enjoying this iconic view and sharing 
it with predictably many clean smelling day tourists. Then down the side of Stevens 
Canyon, stopping for a swim at Louise Lake, past Martha Falls and Syliva Falls.

Partway down Stevens Canyon the trail crosses a place that has been washing out for many 
years now, varying from year to year but often sketchy. This year the washout has become 
much worse, with nothing much holding the trail up from below anymore, so the park is 
recommending against crossing this spot. Trail crews have been hard at work roughing in 
an alternative route, down a scree slope to the river bottom, following cairns along the 
valley floor below the washout, then a short steep scramble back up to the main trail. 
The reroute is raw but feels safe, and I expect will become more solid over the years to 
come. Much gratitude to trail crews for putting this in place.

Foliage becomes lusher and greener as we approach the aptly named Maple Creek. Frank and 
I both remember a distinctive triple bridge over the creek, but this year we find only 
two log bridges, and it's not even clear where the third part used to be. This mountain 
rearranges her furniture on a regular basis!

The day ends with a climb, up through the forest, past Box Canyon, to Nickel Creek where 
we enjoy another sociable dinner followed by an early night.


## Day 12: Nickel Creek to Indian Bar

<p class="subheading">6.8 miles, 3200' gain, 1400' descent</p>

Time to pinch myself again. Am I dreaming? Can this be real? SO pretty! The Cowlitz 
Divide, omg.

Today is all about upwardness. First switchbacking up through woods, then a long ridge 
ascent with views in all directions as a cloud inversion filled the valleys below us with 
wispy white. If someone gave me a sailboat, I'm pretty sure I could float across to the 
various island peaks we see floating in the far distance.

As we drop down from the ridge into the wide valley that's officially called Indian Bar 
but I think should be more respectfully referred to as Cowlitz Bar, the fog rolls up to 
meet us. Views disappear, and our tents become soggy with cloud condensation.

What a day. What a place. I am so blessed to get to be here.

While hiking I've been reading the book <i>Martin Marten</i>, by Brian Doyle, and I 
finished it tonight. Although set on a different Cascade volcano, it's such a vivid and 
thematically appropriate companion to my trip. Plus just a great book, highly recommended.

<p class="subheading">4.7 miles, 2100' gain, 1200' descent</br></br>7.6 miles including my [BansheePeak] side trip</p>

Today is my third time hiking through the absolute marvel of an area known as Ohanapecosh 
Park, and my first time going in this direction, which is uphill. What an uphill it is, 
with a brutal and seemingly endless series of steps carrying us up out of Indian Bar, 
past the cliffs and waterfalls that are the headwaters of the Ohanapecosh River, up into 
the subalpine and then the barren rocky alpine, to Panhandle Gap which is the highest 
point of the entire Wonderland Trail.

Yesterday was pretty, but today elevates that beauty into the realm of the incandescently 
sublime. Looking in front of me, the splendor almost hurts my eyes. Turning around to 
look behind, I can't decide whether to laugh or cry, it's all just so incredible. This 
place, right here, this is my church. My higher power. My soul.

As this was a short day, from Panhandle Gap I added in a few miles of side trip going 
even higher up [BansheePeak].

After a short descent from the gap, Summerland is a beautiful meadow in which to sit and 
enjoy dinner and watch the sunset and feel big feelings.


## Day 14: Summerland to White River

[!FrankAndI.jpg] Frank and I

<p class="subheading">7.0 miles, 700' gain, 2300' descent</p>

My camera broke, so this last day will have to be described using words in place of 
pictures. I guess a bit of Banshee must have got into the mechanism because the focus motor 
doesn't anymore.

We're up and away early, down the trail, first switchbacks, then across Fryingpan Creek to 
a gradual wide path that takes us ever lower through a broad and open forest of big trees 
with minimal undergrowth. It's like a giant cathedral of light and green glowing. We're 
moving fast, with the bit between our teeth as the end of the trip is so close now. This 
hike has been fantastic but we are ready to be done and get home and see loved ones again.

Past the Fryingpan Creek trailhead, things level out for the last couple of miles, and 
our conversation gets silly. Frank decides that if he meets a bear he would try to brush 
it's teeth. We agree that I should be riding a mountain goat, holding both my trekking 
poles in one hand while yodeling, which both of us consider obviously the best way to 
communicate with a goat. We debate whether difficult river crossings could be better 
managed by having trained bears stand at either side ready to toss passing hikers across.

All of a sudden, we're at White River. One last log bridge over a glacial torrent, one 
last view of the mountain, a change of clothes, a quick hug, into our vehicles (comfy 
seats, what madness is this?) and we're going our separate ways. Frank turns right, 
facing an 8 hour drive home, while I turn left just 2 hours from Seattle.

We did it.

[!Reflections.jpg] Drying clothes, tent, sun, trees

Any attempt to walk all the way around a pagan god of rock, ice, and fire was bound to 
have some aspect of a pilgrimage to it, even if this one didn't also happen to be my 
personal spirit mountain.

My first Wonderland trip felt big and important. A pushing of limits and a step into the 
unknown. It mattered to me that I become not just a regular Shawn, but a 
ShawnWhoHasCompletedTheWonderlandTrail, and more broadly a 
ShawnWhoIsCapableOfBigTripsLikeThisOne. This second time around, there was no such 
identity importance attached to the hike. I'm at a stage of my life where my growth and 
excitement are focused in other directions. Instead, the trail felt warm, rich, and 
familiar. It was quality time spent with an old friend. Even when the mountain threw bad 
weather at us, that never felt hostile, just that she was in a cranky mood that day and 
we hoped she'd cheer up soon.

Frank was great company. A strong hiker with a deep knowledge of the trail. This was his 
eighth completed Wonderland circuit! Things I learned from Frank:
<ul>
  <li>
	If leaving shoes outside your tent, put water bottles in them to keep mice out of the 
	shoe.
  </li>
  <li>
	Instead of hanging the permit on your tent, attach it to a hiking pole stuck in the 
	ground at the campsite entrance. This way if rangers come to check the permit while 
	you're asleep, they won't have to wake you by coming right up to the tent.
  </li>
  <li>
	If, like me, you follow a no-washing-up approach to dehydrated meals, pouring boiling 
	water into ziplock bags rather than cooking them directly inside your stove, you'll 
	probably find that eating from a ziplock is messy and unsatisfying. Ergonomics can be 
	improved by placing the ziplock of rehydrated food inside your now empty stove pot, 
	folding the top of the bag out over the rim of the pot. Now you're eating from a 
	well-shaped and rigid pot, but can still just remove and roll up the bag when done, 
	with nothing needing cleaning. It's like a condom for wilderness food.
  </li>
</ul>
