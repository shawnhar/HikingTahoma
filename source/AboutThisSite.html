      <div class="description">
        <img class="mugshot" src="me.png" />

        <p>I am obsessed with Mount Rainier. It is my favorite place to hike, and my 
        spirit mountain. Shortly after moving to the Pacific Northwest in 2005 I
        <a href="https://shawnhargreaves.com/rainier.html">wrote to friends<a>:</p>

        <p><i>"When I wake up and see Rainier on the horizon, I think yeah, this is 
        going to be a good day. In fact this would be a good mountain to worship: a 
        pagan god of rock and ice and strangeness."</i></p>

        <p>For over a decade I enjoyed repeatedly day hiking the same few trails:
        <a href="PanoramaPoint/">Skyline</a>,
        <a href="SprayPark/">Spray Park</a>,
        <a href="GlacierBasin/">Glacier Basin</a>,
        <a href="BurroughsMountain/">Burroughs</a>,
        <a href="PanhandleGap/">Panhandle</a>.
        I noticed and wondered about routes that went further (continuing past Panhandle 
        Gap, and what's that path arriving at Mowich Lake from the southwest?) but I was 
        not a backpacker so these were not for me.</p>

        <p>In 2017 I expanded my limits by visiting <a href="CampMuir/">Camp Muir</a> for 
        the first time. Friends kept asking what came next for my love of Tahoma: would I 
        attempt a summit climb? But I have zero interest in ever standing on the top. 
        Then in 2018 my wife suggested I could train toward hiking the <a 
        href="Wonderland/">Wonderland Trail</a>, and I realized:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>YES! She was exactly right, I did want to do that.</li>
          <li>Before attempting such a thing I needed to broaden my horizons beyond day hiking, gaining backpacking experience on shorter trips.</li>
          <li>Actually, I wanted to hike EVERY trail inside Mount Rainier National Park.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>And thus my Tahoma hiking project was born. The goal of exploring every trail 
        has proven very rewarding. It has challenged and expanded me, deepening my 
        knowledge and enhancing my appreciation of this mountain. There's something 
        special about walking up a valley while remembering how last year I explored on 
        the far side of those same crags, seeing the same views from a different angle 
        and starting to understand how all the pieces fit together across different 
        trails, weather, and seasons. It's a much deeper love than I could get from 
        visiting an area just once. As I expected, this project has brought me beautiful 
        sights, new places to hike, and the satisfaction of working toward a nontrivial 
        goal. Less predictably it's also provided enjoyable research topics, solace 
        during difficult times, and a hiking community that I cherish.</p>

        <p>In the spring of 2020 I was missing my mountain during COVID lockdown, and 
        decided that writing a Rainier hiking guide would be good for my mental health. 
        Hence this website. By the time the trails reopened I was finding enough joy in 
        documenting my explorations that I have continued to update and improve the site. 
        As my father put it: <i>"I feel like you are doing all the trails twice, once for 
        the pleasure of the moment and again for reflection and sharing."</i></p>

        <p>I completed my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yv8Vnn_ZQo">first 
        Wonderland circuit</a> in September 2021, and achieved my goal of hiking every 
        maintained trail in September 2022.</p>

        <p>Many thanks to the National Park Service for publishing the high 
        resolution map I built this site around as public domain. Hopefully 
        needless to say: please do not rely on my maps for navigation. They aim to 
        inform but are insufficient to keep you un-lost.</p>

        <p>This site includes a <a href="Planner.html">Wonderland Itinerary Planner</a> 
        which shows distance and elevation change between your choice of trailheads and 
        campsites, and information about <a href="Wonderland/How.html">how to get a 
        Wonderland permit</a>.</p>

        <p>Hiking Tahoma is dedicated to my wife Tracy, who has varyingly tolerated, 
        supported, encouraged, and joined in with my Rainier hiking obsession:</p>
