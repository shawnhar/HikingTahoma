<p>I am obsessed with Mount Rainier. It is my favorite place to hike, and my 
spirit mountain. When I first moved to the Pacific Northwest I
<a href="http://shawnhargreaves.com/rainier.html">wrote to friends<a>:</p>

<p><i>"When I wake up and see Rainier on the horizon, I think yeah, this is 
going to be a good day. In fact this would be a good mountain to worship: a 
pagan god of rock and ice and strangeness."</i></p>

<p>In the fall of 2018 I realized three things in rapid succession:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to someday hike the Wonderland Trail.</li>
<li>Before attempting such a thing I needed to broaden my horizons beyond day hiking, gaining backpacking experience on shorter trips.</li>
<li>Actually, I want to hike EVERY maintained trail inside Mount Rainier National Park.</li>
</ol>

<p>This website serves as a personal record of the wonderful places I am 
experiencing along the way to my Rainier goal. I'm keeping track of the 
trails I hike for my own satisfaction, and publishing these records in case 
the things I'm learning might prove useful to other Rainier lovers.</p>

<p>The map on the homepage highlights all the trails I have visited so far, 
colored according to which year I first hiked each section of trail. Move 
your mouse over a trail name to highlight where it is located. Clicking a 
trail name leads to a page with notes about that trail, plus a close-up map 
which can be clicked again for a larger version. Many thanks to the National 
Park Service for making the high resolution map these are based on available 
as public domain!</p>

<p>Hopefully needless to say: please do not rely on these maps for 
navigation. They aim to inform, but are insufficient to keep you un-lost.</p>

<p>My difficulty ratings are highly subjective based on my own experience 
of each trail. Be warned that I tend to enjoy long, slow hikes, so I judge 
difficulty more by elevation change or other terrain challenges than raw 
distance. If you prefer steep-but-short over long hauls, take my easy and 
moderate ratings with a pinch of salt :-) Also note that I'm not creating 
separate entries for shorter trails, because who can be bothered to drive 
all the way to the mountain and back just to hike a couple of miles? Instead 
I will roll information about short routes into whatever article covers a 
longer nearby trail: for instance the Trail of the Shadows is described here 
as part of Rampart Ridge.</p>

<p>I measured elevations and distances using <a href="http://caltopo.com">http://caltopo.com</a>.
This tends to produce slightly larger values than are published elsewhere. One 
of the many things I love about Rainier is how you can look up the length of a 
trail in 5 different places, and get 5 different answers!</p>

<p>No apologies for the resolutely early 2000's style of this website. I am 
a hiker and software engineer, but not a web designer :-)</p>
