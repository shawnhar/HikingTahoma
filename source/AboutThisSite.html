<p>I am obsessed with Mount Rainier. It is my favorite place to hike, and my 
spirit mountain. When I first moved to the Pacific Northwest I
<a href="http://shawnhargreaves.com/rainier.html">wrote to friends<a>:</p>

<p><i>"When I wake up and see Rainier on the horizon, I think yeah, this is 
going to be a good day. In fact this would be a good mountain to worship: a 
pagan god of rock and ice and strangeness."</i></p>

<p>In the fall of 2018 I realized three things in rapid succession:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to someday hike the Wonderland Trail.</li>
<li>Before attempting such a thing I needed to broaden my horizons beyond day hiking, gaining backpacking experience on shorter trips.</li>
<li>Actually, I want to hike EVERY maintained trail inside Mount Rainier National Park.</li>
</ol>

<p>This website serves as a personal record of the wonderful places I am 
experiencing along the way to my Rainier goal. I'm keeping track of the 
trails I hike for my own satisfaction, and publishing these records in case 
the things I'm learning might be useful to other Rainier lovers.</p>

<p>The map on the homepage highlights all the trails I have visited so far, 
colored according to which year I first hiked each section. Move your mouse 
over a trail name to highlight where it is located. Clicking a trail name 
leads to a page with notes about that trail, plus a close-up map which can 
be clicked again for a larger version. Many thanks to the National Park 
Service for making the high resolution map these are based on available as 
public domain!</p>

<p>Hopefully needless to say: please do not rely on these maps for 
navigation. They aim to inform, but are insufficient to keep you un-lost.</p>

<p>My difficulty ratings are subjective based on my own experience of each 
trail. I'm assuming a reasonably strong hiker, so 'easy' means Rattlesnake 
Ledge equivalent, and 'moderate' could be long if not too steep. Also note 
that I'm not creating separate entries for very short trails, because who 
can be bothered to drive all the way to the mountain and back just to hike a 
couple of miles? Instead I will roll information about shorter routes into 
whatever article covers a longer nearby trail (for instance the Trail of the 
Shadows is described here as part of Rampart Ridge).</p>

<p>I am not giving star ratings to hikes or sorting by my favorites, for a 
couple of reasons. First, I have yet to meet a Rainier trail that didn't 
have something great about it. Second, back before I got serious about 
hiking every trail I found myself visiting the same few favorites over and 
over again. This was a bad rut as I was missing out on other fantastic 
options. So no more of that way of thinking! I love all the trails, and will 
hike them all, and report on them all, without favoritism.</p>

<p>I measured elevations and distances using <a href="http://caltopo.com">http://caltopo.com</a>.
This tends to produce slightly larger values than are published elsewhere. One 
of the many things I love about Rainier is how you can look up the length of a 
trail in 5 different places, and get 5 different answers!</p>

<p>No apologies for the resolutely early 2000's style of these pages. I am a 
hiker and software engineer, not a web designer :-)</p>
