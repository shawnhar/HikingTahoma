<p>I am obsessed with Mount Rainier. It is my favorite place to hike, and my 
spirit mountain. When I first moved to the Pacific Northwest I wrote to 
friends:</p>

<p><i>"When I wake up and see Rainier on the horizon, I think yeah, this is 
going to be a good day. In fact this would be a good mountain to worship: a 
pagan god of rock and ice and strangeness."</i></p>

<p>In the fall of 2018 I realized three things in rapid succession:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to someday hike the Wonderland Trail.</li>
<li>Before attempting such a thing I needed to broaden my horizons beyond day hiking, to gain backpacking experience on shorter trips.</li>
<li>Actually, I want to hike EVERY maintained trail inside Mount Rainier National Park.</li>
</ol>

<p>This website serves as a record of the wonderful sights and memories I am 
experiencing along the way to my Rainier goal. I'm recording the trails I hike 
for personal satisfaction, and publishing these records in case the things 
I've learned might prove useful to other Rainier lovers.</p>

<p>The map on the homepage highlights all the trails I have visited so far, 
colored according to which year I first hiked them. Move your mouse over a 
trail name to highlight where that trail is located. Clicking a trail name 
leads to a page with notes about that trail, plus a close-up map which can 
be clicked again for a larger version. Many thanks to the National Park 
Service for making the background map I based these on available as public 
domain.</p>

<p>My difficulty rating are entirely subjective, based on my own experience of 
each trail. Be warned that I tend to enjoy long slow hikes, so I judge 
difficulty more by elevation change or other terrain challenges than raw 
distance. If you prefer steep-but-short to long hauls, take my "moderate" ratings 
with a pinch of salt :-) Also note that I'm not creating separate entries for all 
the shorter trails, because who can be bothered to drive all the way to the 
mountain and back just to hike a couple of miles? Instead I will roll 
information about short routes into whatever article covers a longer nearby 
trail: for instance the Trail of the Shadows loop is described as part of 
Rampart Ridge.</p>

<p>I measured elevations and distances using <a href="http://caltopo.com">http://caltopo.com</a>.
This tends to produce slightly larger values than are published elsewhere. One 
of the many things I love about Rainier is how you can look up the length of a 
trail in 5 different places, and get 5 different answers!</p>
