        <p>I am obsessed with Mount Rainier. It is my favorite place to hike, and my 
        spirit mountain. When I first moved to the Pacific Northwest I
        <a href="https://shawnhargreaves.com/rainier.html">wrote to friends<a>:</p>

        <p><i>"When I wake up and see Rainier on the horizon, I think yeah, this is 
        going to be a good day. In fact this would be a good mountain to worship: a 
        pagan god of rock and ice and strangeness."</i></p>

        <p>In the fall of 2018 I realized three things in rapid succession:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>I want to someday hike the <a href="Wonderland/">Wonderland Trail</a>.</li>
          <li>Before attempting such a thing I needed to broaden my horizons beyond day hiking, gaining backpacking experience on shorter trips.</li>
          <li>Actually, I want to hike EVERY maintained trail inside Mount Rainier National Park.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This website serves as a personal record of the wonderful experiences I am 
        having along the way to my Rainier goal. I'm keeping track of the trails I hike 
        for my own satisfaction, and publishing these records in case the things I'm 
        learning might be useful to other Rainier lovers.</p>

        <p>The map on the homepage highlights all the trails I have visited so far, 
        colored according to which year I first hiked each section. Move your mouse 
        over a trail name to highlight where it is located. Clicking a trail leads 
        to a page with notes about it, plus a close-up map which can be clicked 
        again for a larger version. Many thanks to the National Park Service for 
        publishing the high resolution map these are based on as public domain!</p>

        <p>Hopefully needless to say: please do not rely on these maps for 
        navigation. They aim to inform, but are insufficient to keep you un-lost.</p>

        <p>This site also includes a <a href="Planner.html">Wonderland Itinerary Planner</a>, 
        which shows distance and elevation change between your choice of trailheads and 
        campsites.</p>

        <p>My difficulty ratings are subjective based on my own experience of each 
        trail. I'm assuming a reasonably strong hiker, so 'easy' means Rattlesnake 
        Ledge equivalent, and 'moderate' could be long if not too steep. Note that I'm 
        not creating separate entries for very short trails, because who can be 
        bothered to drive all the way to the mountain and back just to hike a couple of 
        miles? Instead I will roll information about shorter routes into whatever 
        article covers a longer nearby trail (for instance the Trail of the Shadows is 
        described here as part of Rampart Ridge).</p>

        <p>I am not giving star ratings to hikes or sorting by my favorites, for a 
        couple of reasons. First, I have yet to meet a Rainier trail that didn't 
        have something great about it. Second, back before I got serious about 
        wanting to hike every trail I found myself visiting the same few favorites 
        over and over again. This was a bad rut and I was missing out on other 
        fantastic options, so no more of that way of thinking! I love all the 
        trails, and will hike them all, and report on them all, without 
        favoritism.</p>

        <p>No apologies for the resolutely 90's style of these pages. I am a hiker and 
        software engineer, not a web designer :-)</p>

        <p>I can be contacted via <a href="https://twitter.com/shawnhargreaves">Twitter</a>,
        plus I'm usually hanging out in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/675281582581927">Wonderland Trail Facebook group</a>.</p>
