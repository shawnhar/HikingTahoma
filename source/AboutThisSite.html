        <p>I am obsessed with Mount Rainier. It is my favorite place to hike, and my 
        spirit mountain. Shortly after moving to the Pacific Northwest in 2005 I
        <a href="https://shawnhargreaves.com/rainier.html">wrote to friends<a>:</p>

        <p><i>"When I wake up and see Rainier on the horizon, I think yeah, this is 
        going to be a good day. In fact this would be a good mountain to worship: a 
        pagan god of rock and ice and strangeness."</i></p>

        <p>For over a decade I enjoyed repeatedly day hiking the same few trails:
        <a href="PanoramaPoint/">Skyline</a>,
        <a href="SprayPark/">Spray Park</a>,
        <a href="GlacierBasin/">Glacier Basin</a>,
        <a href="BurroughsMountain/">Burroughs</a>,
        <a href="PanhandleGap/">Panhandle</a>.
        I noticed and wondered about routes that went further (continuing past Panhandle 
        Gap, and what's that path arriving at Mowich Lake from the southwest?) but I was 
        not a backpacker so these were not for me.</p>

        <p>In 2017 I expanded my limits by visiting <a href="CampMuir/">Camp Muir</a> for 
        the first time. Friends kept asking what came next for my love of Tahoma: would I 
        attempt a summit climb? But I have zero interest in ever standing on the top. 
        Then in 2018 my wife suggested I could train toward hiking the <a 
        href="Wonderland/">Wonderland Trail</a>, and I realized:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>YES! She was exactly right, I did want to do that.</li>
          <li>Before attempting such a thing I needed to broaden my horizons beyond day hiking, gaining backpacking experience on shorter trips.</li>
          <li>Actually, I wanted to hike EVERY maintained trail inside Mount Rainier National Park.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>And thus my Tahoma hiking project was born. The goal of exploring every trail 
        has proven very rewarding. It has challenged and expanded me, deepening my 
        knowledge and enhancing my appreciation of this special mountain.</p>

        <p>In the spring of 2020 I channeled my frustration during COVID lockdown 
        into creating this website. If I couldn't hike, at least I could daydream 
        and write about great hikes of years past! By the time the trails reopened 
        I was finding enough joy in writing about my explorations that I have 
        continued to update and improve the site. As my father put it: <i>"I feel 
        like you are doing all the trails twice, once for the pleasure of the moment 
        and again for reflection and sharing."</i></p>

        <p>I completed a Wonderland circuit in September 2021.</p>

        <p>The map on the homepage highlights all the trails I have visited so far, 
        colored according to which year I first hiked each section. Move your cursor 
        over a trail name to highlight where it is located. Clicking a trail leads 
        to a page with notes about it, plus a close-up map which can be clicked 
        again for a larger version. Many thanks to the National Park Service for 
        publishing the high resolution map these are based on as public domain.</p>

        <p>Hopefully needless to say: please do not rely on these maps for 
        navigation. They aim to inform, but are insufficient to keep you un-lost.</p>

        <p>This site also includes a <a href="Planner.html">Wonderland Itinerary Planner</a>, 
        which shows distance and elevation change between your choice of trailheads and 
        campsites.</p>

        <p>Note that I'm not creating separate entries for very short trails, 
        because who can be bothered to drive all the way to the mountain and back 
        just to hike a couple of miles? Instead I will roll information about 
        shorter routes into whatever article covers a longer nearby trail (for 
        instance the Trail of the Shadows is described here as part of Rampart 
        Ridge).</p>

        <p>I am not giving star ratings to hikes or sorting by my favorites, for a 
        couple of reasons. First, I have yet to meet a Rainier trail that didn't 
        have something great about it. Second, back before I got serious about 
        wanting to hike every trail I found myself revisiting the same favorites 
        over and over again. This was a bad rut and I was missing out on other 
        fantastic options, so no more of that way of thinking. I love all the 
        trails, and will hike them all, and report on them all, without 
        favoritism.</p>

        <p>I can be contacted via <a href="https://twitter.com/shawnhargreaves">Twitter</a>,
        plus I'm usually hanging out in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/675281582581927">Wonderland Trail Facebook group</a>.</p>
