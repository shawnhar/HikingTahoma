This trail is a 0.7 mile spur off the eastern side of the wildly popular 
[PanoramaPoint] loop. It can be hiked as an extension to that route, or 
on its own as an out-and-back from Paradise (which is the mileage shown 
above).

Apparently not many people come this way, as it's the only place I've 
managed to find solitude above Paradise. This is probably because the trail 
name is misleading. At one time there used to be a glacier here, and there 
is still a sign warning about danger around the ice caves, but the glacier 
has retreated and the caves are no more :-(

In their place is a barren landscape consisting of rock, water, and not much 
else. I find it beautiful in a strange, unsettling way.

The trail peters out rather than having a clear end.
