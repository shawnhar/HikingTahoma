This trail has the dubious distinction of not being inside Mount Rainier 
National Park at all. It's actually a section of the Pacific Crest Trail, 
slightly outside the eastern park boundary. That means you can bring dogs!

Start at Chinook Pass, and hike northeast along a level section of trail 
that hugs the side of the valley, parallel to but some distance above the 
road. This is rain shadow terrain, dry and exposed. After a while the trail 
separates from the road (hurrah, no more traffic noise!) before passing 
Sheep Lake, where you are likely to see tents and encounter smelly PCT 
backpackers.

After Sheep Lake the trail heads more steeply uphill, trees dropping away as 
you approach the rocky and impressive high pass of Sourdough Gap. Here the 
PCT veers off to the right, while a second trail heads left entering Rainier 
National Park.

Sourdough Gap is a legitimate point at which to turn around, shaving a mile 
off the total distance, but if you're anything like me you'll have been 
missing the lack of Rainier summit views so far. Just a half mile further, 
as the trail loses altitude, you'll find some tasty views of Her Majesty. No 
dogs allowed on this last stretch, though. Thanks T for hanging onto ours at 
the park boundary while I sprinted ahead!

If you wanted to go further, the trail drops steeply past Crystal Lake and 
then on down to WA 410. Might be neat to through-hike if you can arrange a 
car at both ends?
