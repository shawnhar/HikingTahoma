<span class="trailinfo">This is an off-trail route. Only come here if your navigation is 
up to the task of finding your way where there are no trails to follow, and practice 
Leave No Trace to avoid damaging fragile terrain.</span>

Much of the distance and elevation gain shown above comes from hiking the [Wonderland] 
section to [PanhandleGap]. If you already happen to be at Panhandle Gap, adding in the 
off-trail route to Banshee Peak is 2.9 miles roundtrip with 1000' gain.

Banshee has got to be the best name ever given to a mountain. It makes me want to apply 
warpaint and crank the volume on Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song" (yes, I know I am mixing 
up my cultures here :-) It's a good place to come if you love [BurroughsMountain] but 
wish there was more of it, remoter and with fewer others around.

It's either a long and challenging day hike, or as in my case a detour from a backpacking 
trip. The weather was uncertain when I arrived at Panhandle Gap: clear to the north but 
dense clouds to the south. I was unsure whether I'd get to see anything, but decided to 
take the gamble and it paid off.

The first hurdle was how to begin. There are multiple boot paths heading east from 
Panhandle Gap. I took the lower one, thinking it best matched the topography I was 
expecting. Can confirm that it's possible to reach Banshee that way, but it's not the 
easiest, involving a scramble down a steep scree slope which loses and then has to regain 
more altitude than necessary. Don't do what I did: look at the photo below and go the 
easier way, which provides a clear (unofficial) path for the first portion of the hike.

Most of the way up is a broad ridge-that's-almost-a-plateau, which changes from rich 
wildflower meadows to barren alpine tundra as you gain altitude. There are fragments of 
hiker paths in places, and trails made by the resident goats in others, but you'll likely 
be forging your own route much of the way. This high terrain is incredibly fragile, so do 
your best to minimize damage by stepping on durable surfaces such as rocks, dry 
watercourses, and the bare patches in between sparse alpine plants.
