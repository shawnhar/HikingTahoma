About Mount Rainier

Mount Rainier, aka Tahoma, is my favorite place to hike. It's a 14,411 foot active 
volcano, the most glaciated peak in the contiguous USA, featuring hundreds of miles of 
trails across an astonishing variety of terrain. Lush rainforests, subalpine wildflower 
meadows, alpine tundra, snowfields, glaciers, bizarre volcanic rock formations, wild 
woolly rivers, and a plethora of waterfalls can all be experienced within a single hike. 
Even when you are 'just' hiking
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHiN1rDnbiY">through trees</a>, constant 
changes in altitude plus the rain shadow difference between east and west sides 
of the mountain (east is drier, west very wet) means no two Rainier forests are 
the same.

And then there is the wildlife. I've seen deer, elk, mountain goats, marmots aplenty, 
mosquitoes by the bazillion, pikas, grouse, owls, foxes, and bear. Still waiting for a 
cougar encounter though! Before you panic about those last two: Rainier animals are used 
to hikers, and negative encounters vanishingly rare. Treat them with respect, avoid 
surprising them, keep your food out of their way, and you won't have any trouble.

## Geology|Geology of Mount Rainier

[!Wonderland/2-ColumnarAndesite.jpg]

The geological history of Mount Tahoma is a tale of fire, ice, and flood. She's an active stratovolcano, chosen for special study as one of 16 Decade Volcanoes due to a history of destructive activity, high probability of eruptions in the near future, and proximity to densely populated areas. Like a slumbering giant being crawled over by ants, she occasionally twitches in her sleep, sending hikers and trail repair crews scurrying. One day she may snore or roll over, which would instantly render all the information on this website obsolete.


<p class="heading">Fire</p>

Tahoma exists because of plate tectonics. The Juan de Fuca Plate, which is a small one in 
the scale of such things, lies beneath the Pacific Ocean off the coasts of British 
Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and northern California. It is moving northeast at a speed 
of one inch per year. Meanwhile the North American Plate is moving west around half an 
inch per year. Where they meet, the Juan de Fuca Plate is subducting (sinking) below the 
North American Plate. This causes several interesting things to happen:

<img class="inlinephoto" src="plates.jpg" />

<ul>
<li>
    At the leading edge of the collision, any bumps (seamounts, islands) that were 
    carried along with the Juan de Fuca Plate get scraped off onto the edge of the North 
    American Plate. Hence the Olympic Mountains.
</li>
<li>
    A bit further inland, force of the impact causes the North American Plate to crumple 
    and fold, uplifting the Cascade Range.
</li>
<li>
    As the Juan de Fuca Plate sinks below the North American Plate, water is carried 
    downward along with what was until recently surface rock. 50 miles below the surface, 
    pressure and geothermal heat separate this water from the subducting plate. Water 
    escapes into the hot but dry mantle above, lowering the melting point of that rock, 
    which melts to form magma. Wherever a weakness in the crust above allows, the magma 
    rises and sometimes bursts free to terrify humans and form stratovolcanoes.
</li>
</ul>

Tahoma is a stratovolcano, which comes from the Latin word stratum, meaning layers. 
Today's mountain began forming half a million years ago with a series of lava flows that 
produced mostly andesite, which is a volcanic rock containing an intermediate amount of 
silica. Andesite lava is viscous, but not <i>too</i> viscous, so it can flow, but not 
flow <i>too</i> far. Over time, repeated eruptions will form a giant mound with layers 
poured over the top of other layers, like one of those challenges from the Great British 
Bake Off where they have to assemble a cake from hundreds of individually cooked 
millimeter thick layers of sponge.

Had Tahoma's lava contained less silica, it would have flowed much further before cooling 
into basalt, forming a wider but less steep shield volcano. Had there been more silica, 
it'd be rhyolite, an extremely viscous lava that cannot flow far and tends to plug up its 
vents, building up pressure that leads to explosions.

Which brings us to: some eruptions are explosive rather than producing a gradual flow of 
lava. When lava is flung high in the air, rapid cooling creates tephra such as volcanic 
ash (finely powdered rock), glass particles, and pumice. Being light, these materials can 
be blown much further than lava could flow. If tephra explosions were the only type of 
eruption they would create a small cinder cone volcano, but when they alternate with 
andesite lava flows like at Tahoma, a much larger stratovolcano can alternate andesite 
with tephra layers.

Amazingly, not all of the tephra layers on Tahoma were erupted by this volcano at all! In 
one analysis of a location containing 40 tephra layers, 10 of the layers, including one 
20 inches thick, came from Mount St. Helens, which is 50 miles away. Most of Tahoma is 
covered by a 2 inch tephra layer that flew 250 miles to get there, all the way from Mount 
Mazama. If you're wondering why you've never heard of Mount Mazama before, it's because 
these days she's known as Crater Lake. The reason she changed identity from mountain to 
lake, which is also the reason there is 2 inches of her spread across Mount Tahoma, is 
that she went kittyboom 7,700 years ago.

Tahoma has erupted countless times over her lifetime, and will do so again although it is 
impossible to say when. She could emit lava, ash, pumice, or gases, in amounts small or 
large, and these eruptions could trigger massive landslides.

Her first eruptive stage, half a million years ago, included the lava flows that form 
Burroughs Mountain, the Sunrise area, Grand Park, and Old Desolate. The Colonnade was 
created shortly afterward. Rampart Ridge is a lava flow from 380,000 years ago. The white 
pumice layer seen in the middle of Sunset Amphitheater is from an eruption 190,000 years 
ago. 100,000 years ago, vents on the northwest flank of the mountain, which are visible 
today as the cinder cones Echo Rock and Observation Rock, produced the basaltic andesite 
that covers Spray Park and Mist Park.

  </tr>
</table>

The most recent known small eruptions occurred between 1820 and 1854, when pumice was 
scattered six miles from the summit. In November 1894 Seattle newspapers excitedly 
reported seeing clouds of smoke, and a fresh eruption was speculated, but the summit was 
inaccessible at that time of year and these reports remain unproven.

A complicating factor is that even if the current volcano did not exist, there would 
still be interesting mountains here. Tectonic uplift would still have created the crest 
of the Cascades, which runs only 15 miles east of Tahoma's summit and reaches elevations 
up to 6500'. When you hike the [NachesPeakLoop] or climb [ShrinerPeak] you're standing on 
the results of uplift, not a stratovolcano. A few of these uplifted and folded rocks are 
sedimentary deposits from a coastal plain of 60 million years ago, but they're mostly 
remnants of earlier eras of volcanic activity.

Plate subduction has been happening in this area for a LONG time now. Today's Tahoma is 
only half a million years old, but the first volcanoes started to erupt in this area more 
like 36 million years ago. This is long enough for multiple cycles of mountains growing 
large only to be eroded back down to nothing. The exact shape of mountains in ancient 
times is unknowable, but geologists have identified major periods of activity as the 
Ohanapecosh Formation (andesite lava flows and lahars between 37 and 27 million years 
ago), Steven's Ridge Formation (ash flows and tephra deposits 26 million years ago), and 
the Fifes Peak Formation (basaltic to andesitic lava flows, 25 to 22 million years ago).

Rocks of the Ohanapecosh Formation are exposed at Silver Falls, while eruptive centers 
from that time are visible as the Cowlitz Chimneys. It is tempting to imagine how lava 
from today's Cowlitz Chimneys could have flowed down to Silver Falls, but that is 
entirely the wrong mental model as the landscape then was unrecognizable vs. today. Bear 
in mind that uplift of the Cascades only started 7 million years ago, so some of the 
Ohanapecosh eruptions were taking place underwater! Innumerable cycles of uplift, 
folding, faulting, and erosion have occurred since, using older rocks as raw material to 
make new things.

The Tatoosh Range sits on an intrusive igneous pluton that was formed when a bubble of 
magma neared the surface between 26 and 14 million years ago without managing to break 
free. Cooling slowly underground, it formed large crystals and hardened into 
granodiorite. Capped with an older layer of tephra from the Stevens Ridge Formation, this 
was later uplifted, and softer surrounding rocks were eroded away. Unicorn Peak is made 
entirely of granodiorite, while other Tatoosh summits consist of Stevens Ridge Formation 
sitting on granodiorite bases.

1.4 million years ago, another similarly sized volcano stood in roughly the same place as 
Tahoma today. During an extended lull between eruptions, Tahoma Prime was eroded away 
before volcanic activity resumed and today's mountain began to form. Deposits of lahars 
from this ancestor mountain, known as the Lily Creek Formation, have been found in the 
Cascade foothills west of Tahoma. They match lava remnants near Panhandle Gap that date 
from the same period.

The Goat Rocks Wilderness, 30 miles southeast of Tahoma, is all that remains of another 
large stratovolcano that formed between 3.2 and 1 million years ago before being eroded 
away.


<p class="heading">Ice</p>

Lava flows alone would have produced a symmetrical cone where [Wonderland] hikers could 
enjoy sauntering around a relatively level cross section. But in reality, 
circumnavigating this mountain involves an endless sequence of big climbs up to ridges 
followed by big descents into valleys. The knees and quads of hikers here get good 
workouts thanks to the impact of ice.

Tahoma is heavily glaciated, with 25 major glaciers that cover 35 square miles and hold 5 
times as much ice as all the other Cascade volcanos combined. The Carbon Glacier is the 
longest (6 miles) and thickest (700'), while the Emmons Glacier has the largest surface 
area.

<table class="photos">

Glaciers are constantly moving: creaking, cracking, scouring, and shoving. The Nisqually 
Glacier flows downhill around one foot per day. As glaciers move, they carry rocks that 
have been ground up by their passing or fallen onto their surface from cliffs above. At 
the snout, where the glacier melts away to nothing, these rocks are deposited to form a 
terminal moraine. Other rocks are pushed off the sides of glaciers to form lateral 
moraines. Moraines abound on Tahoma, including less obvious ones like the 11,000 year old 
terminal moraines that dam Tipsoo Lake and Mystic Lake.

Tahoma's glaciers have retreated in recent years. When the road to Paradise was built in 
1910, the Nisqually Glacier extended to within 300 feet of the bridge. Today its snout is 
a mile uphill from there. The ice caves of the Paradise Glacier, once a popular tourist 
destination, became unsafe before collapsing entirely. Today there is no glacier at all 
where the caves used to be.

Most of Tahoma's history occurred during ice ages when the glaciers were much thicker and 
extended further than today. During the most recent ice age, 25,000 to 10,000 years ago, 
ice was 3000' deep at White River and 1500' at Elbe.

One obvious sign of past glaciation is the shape of valleys. The Nisqually, Puyallup, 
Mowich, Carbon, White River, and Cowlitz valleys retain wide U shapes far beyond the 
National Park boundary, which indicates the work of glaciers as opposed to the V shape of 
river erosion.

To anyone wondering why log bridges around the Wonderland wash away so often, and why the 
Park Service doesn't invest in sturdier construction to keep the bridges in place: this 
is due to a combination of past and present glaciation. Glaciers of the past gave us wide 
U shaped valleys (the Carbon valley is half a mile across in many places). Present day 
rivers would normally start to carve V shaped channels into the base of the U, but 
because Tahoma's rivers originate from current glaciers not far upstream, they carry a 
ton of glacial debris. Silt colors the water milky white, and moraine rocks are rolled by 
the current at times of heavy flow. The extraordinary amount of matter moved and then 
deposited by these rivers means they are constantly filling themselves in (a process 
called aggradation), and therefore constantly changing channel to flow over different 
parts of the old glacial U valley floors. There is no point building sturdy permanent 
bridges over whatever channel a river may be using today, because by the time 
construction was finished the river would have switched to a different spot!

Another remnant of past ice ages is the many cirques (rounded bowls) left where glaciers 
once began. Many of Tahoma's lakes occupy cirques: Mowich Lake, Hidden Lake, Deadwood 
Lakes, Lake Eleanor, and Lake George to name just a few.

<table class="photos">
  <tr>

Tahoma is surrounded by ridges where multiple flows of lava have incrementally added to 
the top of the ridge. At one time this presented a mystery: why did lava flow along the 
ridgetops rather than down the valleys? As recently as the 1960s it was hypothesized that 
perhaps what today are ridges used to be the valleys, but then subsequent erosion 
inverted the topology by removing softer old ridges while leaving newer valley lava 
flows. Turns out, nope. What actually happened is that during ice ages the valleys were 
full of ice. I'm sure the drama was intense when lava hit ice, but the end result was the 
lava cooled fast and did not continue to flow. Only along the tops of ridges that 
protruded above the ice could lava flows continue.

Where lava came into contact with ice it created vertical lava cliffs, glassy zones from 
extremely fast cooling, and sometimes crystallized into distinctive columnar structures. 
Examples can be seen all over the mountain.

  <tr>
    <td>[TrailOfTheShadows/Marsh.jpg|Classic ice-cooled lava cliffs at Rampart Ridge, created 380,000 years ago when lava was channeled between the Kautz and Nisqually glaciers, each over 1000 feet deep at the time]</td>

<p class="heading">Flood</p>

Lava flows plus glaciers would have produced a symmetrical cone scoured by deep grooves 
radiating outward. But it only takes one glance at Tahoma to notice that she is neither 
symmetrical nor a cone. Look at the shape of Mount Fuji, or Mount St. Helens prior to 
1980. That's a classic stratovolcano: perfectly symmetrical. Tahoma is differently shaped 
because the Osceola Mudflow is missing from her forehead.

<table class="photos inlinephoto">
  <tr><td>[Photos/Osceola.jpg|One cubic mile of Osceola Mudflow is missing from Tahoma's head]</td></tr>

The importance of lahars was not understood until surprisingly recently, when geologists 
realized just how much of the danger of volcanoes comes from existing material sliding 
down them rather than new lava being erupted. The word comes from Javanese.

Let us imagine a couple of geologists doing research on the Enumclaw Plateau in the early 
1950s:

<blockquote>"It just doesn't add up for this to be residue of a retreating glacier like we'd assumed."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Yeah, but this layer of recently deposited foreign material had to come from <i>somewhere</i>..."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Where could that be?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>(looks up at nearby volcano that has its top rather obviously missing)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Uhh..."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"</blockquote>

Once we knew what to look for, evidence was everywhere. Deposits from more than 60 
different lahars have been identified in the strata of valleys downstream of Tahoma. 
Deeply buried layers of thousand year old stumps and broken tree trunks have been found 
while excavating locations 60 miles from the mountain. It turns out that major lahars 
have occurred roughly every 500 to 1000 years, and smaller ones several times per century.

Lahars vary in scale and root cause:

<ul>
<li>
    At the lower end, water builds up inside the crevasses of a glacier, then is released 
    by heavy rainfall, warm weather, or one of the ~30 small earthquakes that occur every 
    year on Tahoma.
</li>
<li>
    In the mid range, a volcanic eruption melts part of the cubic mile of ice that's held 
    frozen on the upper mountain.
</li>
<li>
    At the high end, over time rock + water + volcanic heat = clay. This hydrothermal 
    reaction gradually turns the solid interior of the mountain into slushy goop.
</li>
</ul>

Common to all these causes is that a bunch of stuff comes rushing down the mountain, 
building volume as it goes. Water, steam, ice, clay, rocks from lower down, trees, 
unlucky hikers, all increase the volume of the lahar. Most lahars follow existing 
watersheds, but large ones have permanently changed the landscape by demolishing barriers 
and damming what used to be valleys, leaving rivers in entirely different places.

The Osceola Mudflow occurred 5600 years ago when an eruption caused hydrothermally 
altered clay to collapse from the northeast side of the mountain. It is one the largest 
lahars known anywhere in the world. Nearly a cubic mile of material fell from the upper 
mountain, reducing Tahoma's height from an estimated 16,000' to 14,100'. This left a 
horseshoe shaped crater 1.1 miles across, open to the northeast and probably not 
dissimilar to the current incarnation of Mount St. Helens. The crater has since been 
partially refilled as ongoing volcanic activity rebuilt the summit cone. The mudflow 
travelled at 50 miles an hour, 500 feet deep as it passed what is today the White River 
campground, carried boulders three feet across fifty miles from the mountain, spread out 
over the Enumclaw Plateau ultimately burying an area of 100 square miles to depths as 
great as 70 feet, and continued moving underwater for more than 10 miles after flowing 
into Puget Sound. Yikes.

The Osceola may be the biggest, but it is far from the only. 2600 years ago, the Round 
Pass Mudflow, again consisting of hydrothermally altered clay, collapsed from Sunset 
Amphitheater and the headwall of the Tahoma Glacier, breaching the west side of the 
crater wall that the Osceola Mudflow had left between Liberty Cap and Point Success. 
Deposits left in valley bottoms are sometimes 100 feet deep. Above Round Pass, remnants 
of this lahar have been found along the trail to Lake George, 1000' above the valley 
bottom. If you're thinking isn't the word "pass" typically a clue that such places tend 
to be higher up, well yes. Puts in grim perspective the advice to seek higher ground if 
you hear a lahar coming, doesn't it? :-)

<img class="inlinephoto" src="lahars.jpg" />

2500 years ago, the not-clay-this-time National Lahar was triggered by massive melting 
during an eruption. It flowed down the Nisqually River and into Puget Sound.

500 years ago, the Electron Mudflow was another hydrothermal clay collapse from Sunset 
Amphitheater on the western side of the mountain. It travelled 50 miles down the Puyallup 
River valley and buried what is now the town of Orting under 15 feet of mud and rock.

Longmire sits on top of a different lahar deposit from around this same time.

Within the last century, Kautz Creek shows the devastation of a debris flow that was 
triggered by heavy rain in 1947. Where the road to Longmire crosses it, the wide main 
channel now lacks a river because Kautz Creek shifted a quarter mile to the east during a 
November 2006 rainstorm.

In December 1963, 12 million cubic yards of rock fell from Little Tahoma onto the Emmons 
Glacier, then travelled downhill at over 90 miles an hour, sliding over a layer of 
compressed air (same principle as a hovercraft) to within half a mile of the White River 
campground. Thankfully, White River was unoccupied at the time so nobody was hurt. This 
is believed to have been caused by a steam explosion near the base of Little Tahoma.

The Westside Road is currently closed to vehicles due to frequent small lahars 
originating from the Tahoma Glacier.

## Indigenous Peoples|

[!Photos/Nisqually.jpg]

For around 8500 years, ever since glaciers retreated after the last ice age, Mount Tahoma 
has provided physical and spiritual nourishment for the people who live around her. This 
mountain looms large in the history, culture, and myth of the region.

<i>Disclaimer: I've done my best to accurately gather and vet the information that 
follows, but sources are incomplete and often contradictory. Please
<a href="mailto:shawnhargreaves@hotmail.com">let me know</a> any corrections.</i>


<p class="heading">Visitation</p>

Indigenous people used the upper and lower parts of the mountain very differently. Above 
the spirit line, which was roughly the permanent snowline around 7000' elevation, was a 
powerful and otherworldly realm. Visits to such rarified places were few and significant, 
part of guardian spirit quests that required ritual preparation and could grant profound 
spirit knowledge.

Below the snowline, the high meadows were an important food source for several tribes. 
Small groups would travel from as far away as the Salish Sea (Puget Sound) to visit for a 
week or two in late August or early September. The primary purpose was for the women to 
gather huge quantities of huckleberries for winter supplies. Meanwhile the men hunted 
deer, elk, bear, mountain goats (which were notoriously challenging due to their 
precarious and high altitude habitat), marmots (for fat and fur), and grouse. Secondary 
activities included collecting pine nuts and bear grass, which was used in weaving 
baskets.

Both berries and meat were dried to preserve them through the winter. The antimicrobial 
properties of cedar containers kept berries from spoiling before they could be dried over 
smoking fires on cedar bark mats. Meat was cut in pieces and hung on wooden frames with 
fires built on three sides to roast it, then moved higher to dry more slowly. Bear meat 
was sometimes steamed in a pit with hot rocks rolled in to form a floor, the meat placed 
on a rack of branches, covered with more branches and a few inches of dirt, then water 
poured in to create steam.

There were no permanent settlements inside what is now Mount Rainier National Park. 
Temporary shelters consisted of lean-tos or conical tipis made from of a frame of poles 
that were tied together at the top and covered with tule mats or skins. Little 
archeological evidence remains due to the temporary visits and dynamic nature of the 
landscape, but arrowheads have been found on peaks in the Tatoosh Range, Van Trump Park, 
the upper slopes of Spray Park, and as high as 7500' on the Success Divide.

Fires were sometimes intentionally set before leaving at the end of the season. This 
maintained habitat by keeping down the brush, boosting berry production for the next year 
and making deer easier to hunt.


<p class="heading">Tribal Identities</p>

To the west and north of Tahoma were the Coast Salish tribes: the Nisqually, Puyallup, 
and Muckleshoot. They spoke Lushootseed, often travelled by dugout canoe, and lived near 
navigable water in villages of cedar longhouses. Salish society was complex and 
hierarchical but there was little political organization beyond the individual village. 
Closest to the mountain, the Nisqually had permanent villages near what are now 
Eatonville and Elbe, the Puyallup near modern Orting, and the Muckleshoot around Buckley 
and Enumclaw.

<img class="inlinephoto" style="max-width:60%" src="tribes.jpg" />

East of the Cascade Crest were the migratory plateau tribes: Yakama, Kittitas, and 
Klickitat. They spoke Sahaptin and rode horses. The Yakama crossed mountain passes to 
visit the eastern flanks of Tahoma, which provided resources not available in their 
sagebrush country further east.

Combining elements of both cultures were the Taidnapam, also known as Upper Cowlitz or 
Cowlitz Klickitat. They lived in permanent villages along the Cowlitz River, including 
the area now called Packwood, but spoke Sahaptin and had close ties to the Yakama. 
Taidnapam / Upper Cowlitz are culturally distinct from the Lower Cowlitz, who are a Coast 
Salish tribe.

Many sources use tribal labels imprecisely, for instance referring to the Taidnapam 
simply as Cowlitz, or grouping the Sahaptin-speaking Yakama and Taidnapam tribes under 
the label Klickitat. I suspect this is partly due to the carelessness of early writers, 
but it is important to recognize that distinct separation of tribes was an outside 
concept imposed during treaty negotiations. Culture and language varied continuously 
without clear breaks. Neighboring but autonomous villages were closely related through 
intermarriage and trading, with especially strong ties within each watershed. The culture 
was cosmopolitan and many individuals (even some whole villages, especially those closer 
to the mountain) were bilingual in Lushootseed and Sahaptin.


<p class="heading">Mythology</p>

In the age before time began, elements of today's landscape were once people who moved 
around, loved and fought with each other. Tahoma is usually but not always female in 
these tales (she's definitely female in my own headcanon).

<table class="photos inlinephoto">
  <tr><td>[PinnacleSaddle/Rainier.jpg|Tahoma, sent away, with son on her hip]</td></tr>
</table>

In Nisqually and Puyallup myth, Tahoma once lived with other peaks in the Olympic 
Mountains, but the others decided there was no room for her there. Sent away along with 
her son, she reminded him to bring water for the journey. Tahoma carried her son (Little 
Tahoma) on her hip to the place where they sit today. He did indeed remember to bring 
water, hence the many streams that flow from the mountain.

<table class="photos inlinephoto">
  <tr><td>[FremontLookout/Baker.jpg|Duh-hwahk gazing back at Kulshan]</td></tr>
</table>

Far to the north, the Lummi (a Coast Salish tribe from the Bellingham area) tell how 
Duh-hwahk (Mount Rainier) was married to Kulshan (Mount Baker) but became jealous when 
Kulshan's affections were stolen by Whaht-kway (Spieden Island), who was less beautiful 
but gentle and kind. Duh-hwahk packed her things, left her husband and three children, 
and travelled far to the south before settling in her current location, where she 
stretched high to see over the intervening hills and gaze longingly back at those she had 
left behind.

I have heard, but cannot attribute the origin, that when clouds roll in so Tahoma is not 
visible it means she has gone on vacation, visiting with her ex-husband or other loved 
ones in some distant place.

<table class="photos inlinephoto">
  <tr><td>[CrystalPeak/Helens.jpg|Legend needs updating: more recently it is Lawetlat'la that has lost her head!]</td></tr>
</table>

In other stories peaks engaged in battle, throwing fire and rocks at each other. 
According to a Cowlitz legend, Tahoma (this time male) once quarreled with his wives 
Lawetlat'la (Mount St. Helens) and Pahto (Mount Adams). Lawetlat'la became jealous, blew 
her top, and knocked the head right off of Tahoma.

Another Cowlitz tale explains why there are no snakes on Tahoma (<i>ed: not strictly 
true</i>). Tyee Sahale once told a wise man to shoot an arrow into the cloud that hung 
low over the mountain, where it stuck fast. The man then shot more arrows into that first 
arrow, making a chain up which he, his family, and all the good animals could climb. The 
bad animals were starting to follow after them, but the man broke the chain of arrows 
just as it began to rain. The land was flooded all the way up to the snowline of Tahoma. 
By the time it stopped raining and the waters receded, all the bad animals had drowned. 
This is why there are no snakes or other bad animals on Tahoma.

The Puyallup have several stories describing lahars (volcanic mudflows). One tells how 
there was once a vast lake in the valley between what is now Sumner and Renton, at which 
time the Puyallup River followed a different course than today. Two whales lived in the 
lake, but one day they became restless, thrashing about and churning up the water. They 
plowed into the land and forced their way through, opening a channel from the plain out 
into the sea. The water followed the whales and a new river came into being.

In another Puyallup story, a young man once climbed Tahoma in search of spirit power. On 
the top he found a lake in which he swam and washed himself, thus gaining magic. Tahoma 
told him he would live so long that moss would grow over him and his hair would fall out, 
and that when he eventually died of old age her head would burst open and the water in 
which he swam would rush down the hillside. And this is exactly what happened. The young 
man grew old, and after he died water burst from the head of Tahoma, swept the trees from 
the valley where Orting now is, and left the prairie covered with stones.


<p class="heading">Placenames</p>

The Nisqually, Puyallup, and Cowlitz tribes share their names with the rivers where they 
lived, which are also the names of the glaciers that feed these rivers and of various 
adjacent geographic features (<a href="IndianBar/">Cowlitz Divide</a>, Puyallup Cleaver, 
etc.) It is meaningless to ask which of <i>"people who live along the Nisqually 
River"</i> or <i>"river inhabited by the Nisqually people"</i> came first.

The Yakima Park area (now known as Sunrise) is named after the Yakama tribe.

The Sahaptin language of the Yakama and Taidnapam contributed some of my favorite poetic 
names:

<ul class="tight">
<li><a href="NachesPeakLoop/">Naches</a> means 'turbulent water'</li>
<li><a href="GroveOfThePatriarchs/">Ohanapecosh</a> means 'standing at the edge' (this was the name of a Taidnapam settlement a few miles outside the current National Park boundary)</li>
<li><a href="IndianBar/">Wauhaukaupauken</a> means 'spouting water'</li>
<li><a href="SouthPuyallupPipeOrgan/">Wow</a> means 'goat' (demonstrating the geographic overlap of languages, as Mount Wow is located well within the territory of the Salish-speaking Nisqually tribe)</li>
</ul>

The Lushootseed language of the Puget Sound Salish gave us:

<ul class="tight">
<li><a href="EaglePeak/">Chutla</a> meaning 'rock'</li>
<li><a href="IndianHenrysFromLongmire/">Kiya</a> meaning 'grandmother'</li>
</ul>

Kiya Lake used to be named after a racist label for Native women, before the Department 
of the Interior finally got around to declaring Sq___ a derogatory term in 2022. While 
we're at it, can we please find more respectful new names for Indian Bar and Indian 
Henry's Hunting Grounds?

The Chinook Jargon was a pidgin trade language with some aspects of a creole, partially 
based on the Chinook language from the lower Columbia River plus elements of other tribal 
languages, French, and English loanwords. During the 19th century it spread as far as 
Northern California, Alaska, and Montana. It was the source of many Tahoma placenames:

<ul class="tight">
<li><a href="FlorencePeak/">Alki</a> means 'by and by'</li>
<li><a href="CarbonRiver/">Ipsut</a> means 'concealed' (perhaps due to the tucked away location of Ipsut Falls)</li>
<li><a href="OwyhighLakesFromDeerCreek/">Kotsuck</a> means 'middle'</li>
<li><a href="SprayPark/">Mowich</a> means 'deer' (because from this angle the rock and ice high on the mountain somewhat resembles a deer's head)</li>
<li><a href="CowlitzDivideTrail/">Olallie</a> means 'berry'</li>
<li><a href="TamanosMountain/">Tamanos</a> means 'guardian spirit'</li>
<li><a href="PinnacleSaddle/">Tatoosh</a> means 'nourishing breast'</li>
<li><a href="NisquallyBoundaryTrail/">Tenas</a> means 'little'</li>
<li><a href="NachesPeakLoop/">Tipsoo</a> means 'grassy, hairy'</li>
<li>Tyee means 'chief, gentleman, officer'</li>
</ul>

There are also some places named after individuals:

<ul class="tight">
<li><a href="OwyhighLakesFromWhiteRiverRoad/">Owyhigh Lakes</a> are named after Chief Owhi of the Yakama.</li>
<li>Satulick Mountain and the meadows known as <a href="IndianHenrysFromLongmire/">Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds</a> are named after So-to-lick, aka Indian Henry, a Taidnapam/Yakama farmer and guide who hunted in this area.</li>
<li><a href="PanoramaPoint/">Sluiskin Falls</a> is named after a Taidnapam guide from the first documented ascent of Tahoma in 1870.</li>
<li>Wahpenayo Peak is named after a chief who was related to So-to-lick by marriage.</li>
<li>Wapowety Cleaver is named after the Nisqually guide of an unsuccessful 1857 summit attempt.</li>
</ul>


<p class="heading">Erasure</p>

Through much of the 20th century the long relationship of Native tribes with Mount Tahoma 
was rounded down to near zero.

Evidence of rare but spiritually significant visits to the upper mountain was discounted 
because the Very Brave and Intrepid Explorers of this Untrammeled Wilderness with all 
their To Boldly Go energy had to be truly the first there, amiright? Let none question 
why the very same people who wrote how Indians were too scared to climb high on the 
mountain were finding the guide services of So-to-lick so very valuable. When Sluiskin 
was hired to guide the First Ever Summit Ascent and he warned of dangers including a lake 
of fire on the summit, this was discounted as primitive superstition because, well, lake 
of fire on top of a volcano? What a ridiculous thing to say :-)

<table class="photos inlinephoto">
  <tr><td>[LongmireStewardshipCampground/NisquallyUseArea.jpg|Restoring access: parts of the Stewardship Campground at Longmire are now reserved for use of the Nisqually Tribe]</td></tr>
</table>

After the 1899 creation of the National Park, erasure broadened to an insistence that 
even the lower mountain had never been much used by Native people. This fabrication 
avoided conflict with treaties such as the one maintaining Yakama rights to hunt, fish, 
and gather roots and berries. In the words of Cowlitz tribal member Bill Iyall:

<i>"If the government wanted to set aside land, they'd say Indian people never used it. 
Actually there was a lot of practical use of Mount Rainier - for food and for fun; for 
family. But the general attitude of the time was that Indians didn't live there. Reports 
refer to the tribal presence as 'visitors'. But Indian people lived there, just not all 
the time."</i>

By combining physical evidence with oral histories, more recent anthropology is starting 
to fill the gaps in this record.


<p class="heading">Tahoma vs. Rainier</p>

Spellings and pronunciation varied, but all the surrounding tribes more or less agreed on 
the name of the mountain. Various sources give the names:

<ul class="tight">
<li>Nisqually: <i>Tahoma, Taqoma, or Tkobed</i></li>
<li>Puyallup: <i>Tahoma or Takhoma</i></li>
<li>Muckleshoot: <i>Taqobid</i></li>
<li>Yakama: <i>Tahoma, Takhoma or Taxoma</i></li>
<li>Taidnapam: <i>Takhoma</i></li>
</ul>

More generally, Tahoma means 'snowy mountain' and can refer to any snow covered peak. 
This linguistic structure is familiar to current residents of Seattle, who universally 
understand the difference of meaning between 'mountain' and 'The Mountain'.

<div style="font-size:67%">The English name Rainier was bestowed by George Vancouver in 
1792, when he saw the mountain from a distance without setting foot on her. He chose the 
name of his friend, a British naval officer who never even visited the region. This 
paragraph is in a small font because these people are just less important than the other 
material on this page.</div>

Naming controversy began in 1873 when a young sawmill town called Tacoma was selected as 
the terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad. An influx of railroad money smelled a 
marketing opportunity to rename Mount Rainier and have it match their new town, but 
newspapers and businesses in rival Seattle raised objections:

<ul class="tight">
<li>We can't violate the longstanding principle that the first white man to see something gets to name it for perpetuity.</li>
<li>Who even knows what Native people called the mountain? So many different tribes and spellings...</li>
<li>Tacoma could refer to any snowy mountain, not always specifically Rainier.</li>
<li>Native people never visted the mountain much anyway...</li>
</ul>

The debate continued past a pro-Rainier 1890 ruling by the US Board of Geographic Names. 
Teddy Roosevelt chimed in favoring an indigenous name, and in 1917 the state legislature 
passed a resolution to rename, but the effort stalled. Perhaps conditions are ripe for 
another try soon?

Hiking trails vary from easy to access and popular (aka crowded...) to obscure and 
remote. Trails are generally well maintained and signposted, so navigation is not 
difficult. A major exception is if you're travelling over snowfields, such as to Camp 
Muir, over Panhandle Gap or Spray Park before they melt out, or hiking early/late in the 
season. Do not hike over snow unless you understand the dangers of snow bridges, and are 
prepared to navigate through a white-out or to hunker down and wait if the weather turns 
on you! It's a true saying that the mountain makes its own weather, and people have died 
from underestimating what this means at high altitude.

Another potential risk, mostly affecting backpackers, can be the more remote river 
crossings. Bridges are prone to washing away, and glacial meltwater can be challenging to 
ford if you want to cross before the Park Service gets around to replacing them.

Rainier is at its best between late July and September. There can also be great hiking in 
the rump seasons of May, June, October, and November, but these months require more 
research, attention to weather forecasts, and awareness of snow levels. The road up to 
Paradise is kept plowed during the winter, so high altitude snow sports remain accessible 
all year.


<p class="heading">Backpacking</p>

The epic [Wonderland] (over 90 miles circumnavigating the mountain) is the jewel in 
Rainier's backpacking crown, but there are also many options for shorter loops or section 
hikes. Backpacking on Rainier can feel remote (few other people, a long way from road 
access) but also strangely tame as there are designated campsites with maintained pit 
toilets and bear poles for hanging your food.

Permits are required to camp on Rainier, because designated campsites means there are 
only a fixed number of spaces to go around. The normal system is that 2/3 of available 
capacity is allocated through a lottery during March, while 1/3 is held in reserve for 
walkup permits. Walkups are issued on an as-available basis to anyone who arrives in 
person at a ranger station for a trip starting that day or the day after. Some years are 
different, though. In 2016, all permits were walkup due to a software problem. In 2020, 
all permits were issued in advance due to the COVID pandemic.

This site includes a <a href="Planner.html">Wonderland Itinerary Planner</a> which shows 
distance and elevation change between your choice of trailheads and campsites, and 
information about <a href="Wonderland/How.html">how to get a Wonderland permit</a>.


<p class="heading">Access</p>

There are four main ways into the park: the Nisqually entrance (which leads to Longmire 
and Paradise) at the southwest, a northeast entrance leading to White River and Sunrise, 
the less developed Carbon River and Mowich Lake on the northwest side, and the southeast 
Stevens Canyon / Ohanapecosh entrance.

A fee is required to enter the National Park. If you plan on visiting more than once, 
it's much cheaper to buy an annual pass. Or if you only plan on visiting once, WHAT IS 
WRONG WITH YOU??? :-)

Dogs other than service animals are not allowed on trails inside the National Park.

Parking spaces tend to fill up early, and waiting lines at the park entrances can be long 
on sunny summer weekends. I recommend arriving early to skip the crowds, find solitude on 
the trail, and boost your chances of seeing wildlife. Some of my most treasured memories 
are from hikes where I arrived at Sunrise as early as 4 AM, then watched the sun come up 
around me while already on the trail.

If you are visiting from out of state, you'll probably want to rent a car. Mount Rainier 
is not accessible by public transport, and although you could take a taxi or private 
shuttle service, these are expensive not to mention tricky to coordinate the return 
journey as there is not much cell service inside the park.


<p class="heading">Lodging</p>

Outside but near to the park, look for places to stay around Ashford, Enumclaw, Packwood, 
or between Greenwater and the Crystal Mountain ski resort.

Inside the park, car camping is available at Cougar Rock and Ohanapecosh (by reservation) 
and White River (first-come-first-served).

There are two historic lodges: the National Park Inn at Longmire, which is open year 
round, and the Paradise Inn at (duh) Paradise, which typically opens mid May to early 
October. Both make lovely bases from which to explore their surrounding areas. Rooms are 
small by modern standards, without AC, and many lack private bathrooms, but they do the 
job. A stay here is about location, ambiance, and history rather than modern hotel 
luxury. The Paradise Inn is busier and more architecturally impressive, while the 
National Park Inn boasts a mellow porch where Wonderlanders often stop by to enjoy a 
snack. The restaurant food is expensive and limited in variety, so if you are staying 
more than one night I'd recommend augmenting it by bringing a cooler with supplies of 
your own.

The Longmire Museum is small but worth visiting. It has an impressive taxidermy 
collection, from bygone days when it was considered appropriate to respond to seeing a 
marmot, fox, owl, or cougar by shooting and stuffing them.

<i>"Sunrise to Paradise: The Story of Mount Rainier National Park"</i>, by Ruth Kirk, 
covers the geology, biology, history, and sociology of the mountain. Great information 
about how Native people used the area before white settlers arrived, and the gradual 
evolution of thinking around what the purpose of a National Park should be. Also, many 
wonderful photos.

<i>"A Year in Paradise"</i>, by Floyd Schmoe, is a firsthand account beginning in 1920 
with a young couple caretaking the Paradise Inn while buried under deep snow. It follows 
the changes brought by the arrival of spring and a career shift to work as a mountain 
guide, and ends with Floyd taking his wife and young son around the Wonderland Trail on 
horseback (using the same horse that had carried supplies up to build the guide hut at 
Camp Muir, no less). Vivid descriptions overflow with loving observations of plants and 
animals, from someone who went on to become a Park Ranger and then the Park's first 
official Naturalist.
